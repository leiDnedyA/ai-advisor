What can the evolution of the genre tell us about the ways in which American ideas about power, politics, morality, and heroism have changed over the past eighty-five years?

It explores the diversity of work and working-class experiences, the history of labor movements, labor conflicts, and the larger processes of social, economic, and political change that have affected work and workers. While work and organized labor receive central attention, the course gives equal consideration to the comparative dimensions of class and cultural identity, race and gender, immigration and ethnicity, family and community, technology, politics, and government policy. We will work to improve our skills in critical reading and writing. Lectures, readings, videos, and discussion explore the actions, opinions, identities, and experiences of diverse women and men. You will work on understanding and interpreting the materials. Short essays, in-class exams, and presentation will provide opportunities to develop your interpretations systematically and polish your writing skills."

It explores narratives about how human family structures evolved, examines the increasing medicalization of reproduction and the body, and takes stock of the ways in which race, class, gender, and sexual orientation affect commonly held and frequently subscribed-to beliefs about what constitutes family. It illustrates the diversity of kinship definitions with ethnographic examples from the Iban of Indonesian Borneo, the Nyakyusa of East Africa, and other societies from the Americas, Africa, Asia, and the pacific Islands. Through an exploration of the pressures to which African American families have been subjected in the United States, it probes the ways in which the legacy of slavery shapes the possibilities and perceptions of contemporary families."

In this course we deconstruct familiar discourses about things through an examination of the world of material possessions, places, people, ideas, and space in cross-cultural perspective. Our aim is to gain more nuanced understanding about the apparent human tendency to create our identities through assigning personal and cultural significance to objects around us. Course readings will be drawn primarily from anthropology, art history, art criticism, cultural studies, and curatorial/museum studies. We will also share our observations, experiences, and reflections of particular object worlds through museum site visits, class discussions, and individual projects. Our own milieu of the Western museums will offer valuable case studies about the historical and political implications of particular histories of collecting, classifying, displaying, and interpreting the wider world as a collection of objects."

Understanding the processes through which the social environment \"gets under the skin\" to influence health has become an important question across medical and social science fields, including anthropology. This course will explore key social determinants of health being explored by medical and bio-cultural anthropologists, including: socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, neighborhood environments, social relationships, and political economy. Mechanisms through which these factors are hypothesized to influence health, such as stress and access to health resources and constraints, will be discussed, as well as the ways in which these mechanisms operate within communities and across the life-course. An overarching theme of the course will be how social factors that adversely affect health are inequitably distributed, contributing to marked health disparities."

A range of systems of production, distribution and consumption in contemporary and past economies will allow students to systematically critique familiar economic ideas and institutions. Topics will include reciprocity and redistribution, traditional markets, notions of scarcity, affluence and fairness, the regulation of economic behavior by formal and informal institutions, the economic division of labor and the interface between modern and traditional economies.",

The course will look at films directed, produced and written by indigenous and non-indigenous film-makers. We will examine films from a number of different geographical areas, concentrating on North America (the United States and Canada), Aotearoa/New Zealand, Australia, and Southern Africa. We will also be looking at a select number of films from other areas in relationship to specific issues, these include Tuvalu, Kazakhstan and Guatemala. As part of the course structure, we will also be engaging with a number of specific issues. These include colonialism, identity, the importance of land, environmental destruction, gender, coming of age, new media platforms, the impact of commercial media, and commodification and appropriation of indigenous peoples. A select number of film-makers will also be joining the course as guest lecturers."

How do the body's priorities change, and what can we learn about the selective pressures that shaped human evolution when we examine those changes in the context of ecological and cultural variation? How, at the threshold of adulthood, is gender newly constructed, and what commonalities and cultural variations in the gender inculcation process exist across the glove? Texts will include literature on human growth and development; comparative data from non-human primates; anthropological literature on rites of passage viewed cross-culturally; and literary dramatizations of coming of age."

It enables the student to grasp the expressive content of works of art in a wide variety of media and to analyze how the artist creates his/her effect. It is not an historical survey. Through lectures, discussions, field trips, and museum visits, the student studies paintings, sculptures, and buildings; examples are chosen as often as possible from the Boston area. The course addresses such concepts as elements of composition, rhythm, symmetry, and space; and the possibilities of differing interpretations of subject matter. It offers a solid introduction to the arts by developing the student's ability to see and analyze forms as the result of aesthetic and interpretive decisions."

Our aim is to gain more nuanced understanding about the apparent human tendency to create our identities through assigning personal and cultural significance to objects around us. Course readings will be drawn primarily from anthropology, art history, art criticism, cultural studies, and curatorial/museum studies. We will also share our observations, experiences, and reflections of particular object worlds through museum site visits, class discussions, and individual projects. Our own milieu of the Western museums will offer valuable case studies about the historical and political implications of particular histories of collecting, classifying, displaying, and interpreting the wider world as a collection of objects."

By reading the stories of individuals and groups in these contexts, the course explores how socio-cultural notions of gender and sexuality, often deeply embedded among communities; perpetuate inequalities among South Asian subjects. It utilized life history, the novel, film, political critique and other literary genres to examine cultural and material foundations of inequality in contemporary South Asia, especially among women of particular religions, class, caste, and ethnicities.",

This course explores a range of contemplative practices, mainly from Hindu, Buddhist, and/or Daoist traditions. We will also explore modern, secularized offshoots of these practices, such as mindfulness and postural yoga, which are now used widely in clinical settings and are the subject of much scientific research. The course will draw on perspectives such as the comparative study of religion, philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. Moreover, we will approach meditation both academically and experimentally: participants will study contemplative practices in their historical, cultural, and religious contexts, wand will likewise engage in the practice of mediation, in both traditional and modern varieties. Going beyond seated mediation, we will explore contemplative practices and the traditional creative arts (e.g. poetry and calligraphy); musical meditations; and contemplative body-mind practices (e.g. poetry and calligraphy); musical meditations; and contemplative body-mind practices (e.g. walking meditation, yoga, and/or Qi Gong). The course hence integrates conventional academic study with a unique form of experiential learning. Meditation practice is an essential component of the course.

The general goal of this 300-level series is to understand how the various organ systems work in the human body to sustain life. It is also the goal of this full-year course for students to appreciate how disruptions to homeostasis affect the whole organism, with a strong focus on the physiological underpinnings of disease. In this second semester, we will be discussing the anatomical and physiological integration of the organ systems to maintain homeostasis as well as some aspects of disease states. Course content will include endocrine and hormonal homeostatic control mechanisms, as well as cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, urinary, immune, reproductive systems.",

By comparing different systems from viruses, bacteria, plants, nematodes, insects, and vertebrates, students will gain perspective on the development and function of immune systems. The course will cover the emerging concepts of biological individuality (self and the microbiome) and models of immune development and response. Intended to complement, but not to replace, a course in human immunology, students will learn about trade-offs with immune function, and how immunological responses of individuals scale up to the population and ecosystem levels by exerting influence on pathogen transmission. In particular, comparative sickness behaviors, social distancing, and pathogen avoidance behaviors will be one focal topic. Traditional components of immunological study will be contextualized within model systems forming the core of the course (taxonomic and anatomical comparative immunology) and include mucosal immunity, neuroimmunology, innate immune priming, and adaptive immunity.

Over the course of two-week modules, we will delve into comprehending a new function of business and discover how these principles apply and become relevant in real-world business environments through an integrated course project to which each student contributes:  a social impact business plan. The social impact business plan is a strategic document that outlines how a business intends to address a social or environmental challenge, while maintaining financial viability. We add to these practical areas an understanding of the contexts in which business operates - law, government, society, rapidly changing technology, new risks, the changing nature of careers, increasingly diverse workforces, and the broad global reach of business. This course will develop your capabilities in reading and critical thinking, oral and written communication, working in teams, information technology, academic self-assessment, and professional etiquette.",

            "description": "People have been trying to understand the fall of Rome since the fall of Rome. In 200 CE, the Roman Empire was the largest, most diverse, and most powerful state the Mediterranean world had ever seen. By 500, the Western half of the Empire had splintered into smaller kingdoms that would eventually become the basis for modern European states. What happened? This course will examine the political, military, environmental, and social changes of the Empire as it loses territory and transforms into the medieval world. But we will spend just as much time trying to understand what it was like for typical Romans to live through this period. We will study armies and taxes, but also the rise of Christianity, the prevalence of slavery, the shifting gender norms, and the stories that filled the imaginations of people throughout this time. We will discuss major ancient cities like Rome and Constantinople, but we'll also venture out to the edges of the Empire and beyond learning about the Goths, Celts, Sassanians, and more.In addition to learning about the transformation of the Roman Empire between 250 and 800, students will also practice thinking like historians; that is, we will think about possibilities and limitations of the wide range of sources that historians use to piece together what happened and why it matters. How do we know what we know about the past? And why should we care how history is written?  ",

In addition to examining the disproportionate impact on low-income, communities of color, and Indigenous peoples, we will examine how these communities are leading resistance to ecological disasters and environmental violence. We will examine the power dynamics of environmental issues via media and film, journalism, public relations, advertising, rhetoric, and public participation and activism to understand how communication can create a more just and sustainable world. Students will interpret and analyze the voices of individuals and groups struggling to define major environmental topics, such as: climate change and pollution, energy, water, food and agriculture, biodiversity and extinction, ocean life, wilderness habitat, war, and consumerism.",

These students may want to learn the current language of CS 110, or may be interested in the material of CS 110 as a means of preparing for the follow-up course, which is CS 210. Such students can, with permission of the department, register for CS 119 for two credits. They then make arrangement to attend a section of CS 110. They are required to do all the assignments, examinations, etc., of regular CS 110 students. Thus, in virtually all respects, students who register for CS 119 are really CS 110 students, except that CS 119 meets no core curriculum requirement and does not count towards any computer science major requirement."

Through both oral and written presentations, they analyze and interpret readings taken from college-level texts. They learn to distinguish the methods authors use in developing their ideas and the differences and similarities among perspectives of various authors, as well as to recognize implications and to question authors' purposes.

The dance form involves \"a complex array of interlocking rhythms, percussive accents of isolated body parts popping out in unexpected phrasing,\" (Andre Lepecki, ed., Of the Presence of the Body, 2004). Key figures in its early development in the 1970's are Afrika Baambata, a rapper who is credited with forming the first group of hip hop dancers, and DJ Kool Herc of Jamaican origin who brought his two turntables to the block parties in the South Bronx. Its influences range from African dance and Brazilian Capoeira to James Brown, Michael Jackson and, more recently, music videos. This course covers the variety of components that make up Hip Hop Dance: poppin', lockin', wavin', steppin', top rockin', and downrockin' and basic breakin'. The course material will help students develop strength, coordination and a strong mental focus while they thoroughly enjoy moving themselves to the lively rhythms of hip hop music. This is a practical course in which the great majority of time will be spent practicing dance technique and choreography. While we may occasionally view a video, most of our time will be spent actually dancing. We will become familiar with basic Hip Hop moves and practice putting these moves into combination in challenging ways. We will further enhance our knowledge of Hip Hop through the writing of two papers. Material learned in class will prepare us for an end-of-semester studio performance."

The second half of the course examines each superpower (e.g. gratitude, compassion, authenticity) with respect to the scientific and theoretical underpinning of each construct, as well as evidence-based practices for developing these skills professionally and nurturing these in children. The course will also examine social justice and educational policy contexts and systemic approaches to preventing children's exposure to trauma and toxic stress.",

Does education affect people's behavior in ways that make them \"fit\" better or worse in the large enterprises of the economy? Whose interests are served by the structure of our educational system? How does the educational system affect economic, social and political equality?

We will begin by describing the trends in income inequality in the United States in comparison to other developed nations. We will consider possible causes and consequences of income inequality. We will examine a range of social and economic effects on income inequality including economic growth, intergenerational economic mobility, educational outcomes as well as health and happiness outcomes. We will then describe policies focused on households in both the top and the bottom of the income distribution.In addition to introduction students to the forces behind inequality, This course offers students the opportunity to work on critical analysis skills in a small-sized course. this includes reading thoughtfully, by assessing the arguments and evidence provided by authors; thinking carefully about one's own beliefs and how they shape one's perspective on these issues; and communicating well-articulated arguments, both orally and in a written form.",

These topics will be covered at a more advanced level than they are covered in existing courses and will provide the basic framework for the remainder of the course. In the second part of the course, which constitutes the bulk, students will have an opportunity to engage with a specific topic in greater depth. This topic will vary with the instructor teaching the course. The proposed topics are: Urbanization in Developing Countries, Poverty and Inequality, Structural Change and Transformation, Gender and Development, War, Macroeconomic Issues in Developing Countries, and Political Economy of Development. Whichever the area, students will be given the skills necessary to critically analyze the process of economic development, to identify the winners and losers in this process, and to appreciate what would constitute just and sustainable policy in that area.",

This course is organized around three primary sets of questions within the field of urban economics. The first focuses on the development of urban areas. Why do cities exist and why do some grow more rapidly? The second area addresses patterns of development within metropolitan areas. How do firms and households decide where to locate within given metropolitan areas? What determines the price of land, and how do these prices vary across space? The third and final area concerns the spatial dimensions of urban problems. Specifically, we will examine poverty, housing, and congestion. In addition to a rigorous study of urban economic theory, this course will also include a team based consulting project for a specific client in the city of Boston. Students will receive their client at the beginning of the semester and will conduct original empirical research to address their client's concerns.",

You know you must prevent them at all costs. After all, whoever controls this new technological invention can rule the world. Your mission is to save the world, that is in the context of the game story in this class. To do so, you are not expected to begin with any coding skills but must learn basic coding concepts such as debugging, looping, and Boolean logic to solve a series of problems embedded within this game story in order to advance the storyline. Designed like a video game, it is an asynchronous online course that can be completed at your own pace. By the end of the class, you will code your own interactive game using a block-based programming language.

You will understand that these disciplines are not merely a body of facts, theories, and techniques. rather, they involve diverse processes by which knowledge is continually generated and reformulated.Sciences typically discussed in Perspectives include biology, physics, geology, astronomy, and chemistry. The course traces the development of key notions in these sciences and seeks to correct common myths or defective portrayals of history in science textbooks. We will also discuss the question of whether mathematics is itself a science. The course provides historical perspectives on how practical needs, social conflicts, and even individual personalities shaped the content and direction of the disciplines.An additional objective of the course is to convey that scientific and mathematical concepts are not static. The goal of the course is to promote among UTeach students the understanding that even the most basic ideas of science and mathematics are dynamic, despite the way this information is presented in K-12 textbooks."

Through the study of theories of writing, students in Composition I gain knowledge of core key concepts, including audience, purpose, and genre, which help them understand writing as a rhetorical meaning-making activity that responds to situations and generates new perspectives. Through cycles of writing, feedback, revision, and reflection, students advance their ability to develop informed, critical perspectives and articulate claims in dialogue with complex texts. Students gain rhetorical awareness by composing texts that account for audience expectations for language and genre and reflecting on their own writing and learning. The flexible, adaptable writing knowledge and practices developed in Composition I are designed to facilitate students' self-reflective writing in other contexts.",

            "description": "Composition II is an introductory course on writing theory and practice that reinforces and extends the foundational knowledge and practices introduced in Composition I. While students in Composition I focus primarily on writing to make meaning, students in Composition II learn how writing produces knowledge. Students come to understand writing as a knowledge-producing activity through carefully sequenced and scaffolded assignments that encourage them to develop, sustain, and reflect on their own academic inquiry and research processes. Assignments ask students to develop original research questions, locate and evaluate primary and secondary sources, select evidence from multiple complex texts, synthesize evidence-based arguments that use sources to address their inquiry, and reflect on their own learning and development. In conjunction with Composition I, students in Composition II continue to develop the ability to generate and articulate their own claims in dialogue with texts and to develop rhetorical awareness and knowledge of academic discourse conventions. The flexible, adaptable writing knowledge and practices developed across Composition I and Composition II are designed to facilitate students' ability to write self-reflectively in other contexts, which includes intermediate seminars, upperlevel courses, and the Writing Proficiency Requirement.",

Classic and contemporary examples of the genres of poetry and fiction will be studies with the goal of understanding the ways writers imagine elements of language, structure, and process to create a fully developed work. Class work will include in-class writing, examinations, creative-writing assignments, and attendance at one poetry or fiction reading during the semester with the goal of producing a final portfolio of creative work."

This course investigates why, in our increasingly sophisticated storytelling culture, we turn to novels that are supposedly aimed at a \"younger\" audience. What attracts readers of all ages to young adult literature? We will examine how these novels use well-known plot structures and literary devices to create compellingly artistic stories. We will also examine how young adult literature tackles difficult topics, such as race, class, gender, and sexuality, in stories that mange to be both accessible and deeply thought provoking in their portrayals of diversity. Although this class features young adult literature, it has a heavy reading load and a fast-paced reading schedule."

Our goal is to prepare students for the future, but our teaching is rooted in the past. We want students to become independent, but we expect them to follow rigid rules. With all these contradictions it's no surprise that education doesn't 'work' for every student. This class will problematize education by examining our own experiences, looking at literary representations of school and learning, and putting both of them in conversation with what theorists and experts have to say. We will ask whether what we read can lead to a deeper understanding of our own experiences and our culture by examining themes such as gender, race and racism, socioeconomic and poverty, literacy and language and power structures. Working with critical concepts and terminology will enable us to reach a better understanding of how the writing we read works and will help us tell own stories more effectively. In the end you will use your understanding and your experience as a means to developing a potential solution to one of the problems of education."

Serving as an introduction to humanistic and literary studies, the course considers how these texts, written in both prose and verse, reflect, shape, and/or critique the dominant values of their ages. The course takes up such questions as what is literature and what makes it British? How do these texts engage with the history, dialects (early, modern, and contemporary), and fluidity of the English language? How do these works register and respond to the rise and decline of the British empire? How does the changing multiracial and multiethnic composition of Britain impact its literature over time? In order to address these questions and others, the course offers instruction in analytical reading and writing.",

And what unique insights does literature provide into those same histories and cultures? This course satisfies the US Diversity requirement, and as such, all sections will foreground marginalized perspectives and interrogate how literature both challenges and upholds oppressive social structures.",

The answers to these questions for students of literature, rhetoric, and language are found in archives, living treasures of human experience. This course is an exploration of archives generally and Boston archives in particular, as it creates an opportunity for students to read and interpret letters, diaries, journals, books, short stories, publications, and other original literary material in order to discover the specific literary, cultural, geographic, and social moments in which they were created. The course will feature field trips, workshops, and instructional research sessions in order to engage with material like the Hemingway Papers at JFK Library and Archive, meet literary women preserved within the Schlesinger Library at Harvard's digital repository, learn about community archives for LGBTQ Boston, and examine multiple local collections from the University Archives and Special Collections on UMass Boston's campus. This course teaches basic methods for students to begin to construct and reconstruct stories, and to start out further work where the individual's interests in literature, writing, theory, and/or language may take them. The course is aligned with the aims of the Humanities General Education requirement which asks students to develop an informed appreciation of human culture and an exploration of the human condition, and is a hands-on, Interactive course designed with the support of the Mellon Foundation."

This course will examine the ways in which the techniques of literature (e.g., narrative, description, point of view, voice, image) compel readers' attention and bring us nearer to turn to human rights abuses and peoples' capacities to survive and surmount these conditions."

            "description": "Sustainability, doing what we can now to preserve the environment for the future, is made up of three pillars: environment, economics, and social equity. The environment pillar refers to the goods and services provided by our planet for survival of humans and non-humans. The economics pillar refers to the reality of ensuring livelihoods are protected and enhanced while the environment is being protected for future generations. The social equity pillar refers to ensuring all groups are treated equally and fairness in environmental-decision making for future generations is front and center. Being sustainable, or green, sounds simple, but in practice is not easy. Often, sustainability is pawned off as a quick fix solution, but is this what is best for the long term? Students in this course will learn about, discuss, and act upon the components of sustainability and their role in sustainability by investigating the opportunities and challenges of sustainability in context of their daily lives, their future, and our future generations."

            "description": "This course will examine the basics of working in and managing a successful aquaculture operation. Aquaculture is currently the fastest growing segment of the food industry, with more then half of what we eat from the ocean coming from aquaculture. This is an increasingly competitive space that suffers from a tradition of malpractice and misunderstanding as well as a regulatory culture that lags far behind an innovative rate. Site selection, gear, seed and feed procurement, marketing, and supply chain dynamics are all important elements of a successful aquaculture operation that demand an understanding of regulatory, financial, and marketing and entrepreneurial principles. This course is designed to introduce students to these challenges and equip them with the tools needed to engage within the industry on a sophisticated, successful level. Students will gain a foundational understanding of how to move from \"I would like to operate an aquaculture business\" to \"I am operating an aquaculture business\". Building on this understanding, students will prepare their own business plans to demonstrate mastery of key aspects of operational efficiency necessary support the vital financial structure of any business. Lastly, through the concepts of entrepreneurship, students will learn how to integrate business concepts to be able to develop and sustain a successful aquaculture business. This course will be organized into three parts: Essentials for a business in aquaculture, operating a business in aquaculture, and moving from concept to execution. This course alludes to but does not deeply discuss the complex and ever changing regulatory, policy, and legal systems that govern operations in this sector."

This course introduces methods of quantitative reasoning used to understand our environment. Through a wide variety of examples, the course builds connections between quantitative concepts and environmental applications. Physical and social scientists measure properties of the environment to gain an understanding of the past and present, then they use these measurements to compare changes in the environment both spatially and throughout time. This course will examine topics such as population dynamics, changes in weather and climate, toxicity in water and air and the occurrence and intensity of natural disasters. Using real world data, the course will develop quantitative and technical skills for critical analysis of environmental challenges. Some of the quantitative topics presented include estimation, number sense, graphing data, linear and exponential growth and descriptive statistics, including central value analysis. This course meets the core theme of better understanding environmental science by addressing quantitative studies applied to climate change, sustainability, environmental justice and pollution.ENVSCI 116L and ENVSTY 116L are the same course",

We foreground how racial, ethnic, socioeconomic class, and gender groups experience ecological disasters intensified by climate change. In addition to examining the disproportionate impact on low-income, communities of color, and Indigenous peoples, we will examine how these communities are leading resistance to ecological disasters and environmental violence. We will examine the power dynamics of environmental issues via media and film, journalism, public relations, advertising, rhetoric, and public participation and activism to understand how communication can create a more just and sustainable world. Students will interpret and analyze the voices of individuals and groups struggling to define major environmental topics, such as: climate change and pollution, energy, water, food and agriculture, biodiversity and extinction, ocean life, wilderness habitat, war, and consumerism.",

Students will write issue or analysis reports for each issue and discuss the issue in class via general discussion, panel discussions, role-play discussions, and debates. This fourth-year seminar course also is designed for vertical alignment of the curriculum and cohort development for environmental studies and sustainability majors.",

This course places particular emphasis on expanding the student's level of understanding of functional musculoskeletal anatomy. Mechanical and anatomical concepts essential for understanding human movement are integrated routinely through this course. After introductory sections on these underlying kinesiological principles, this course systematically progresses through the human body on a joint by joint basis, and then explores the synergistic interaction of all joints systems that is the hallmark of human motion. Topics of focus will include classification of joint systems, connective tissue anatomy and biomechanics, arthrokinematics, and kinetics. Clinical and athletic application of these principles will be made through sections on the biomechanics of sport and exercise.",

Through an interdisciplinary lens, we explore how engagement in the arts and cultural activities shapes the aging process, promotes well-being, and fosters social connection. We analyze representations of aging in literature, film, and performance, critically interrogating the assumptions and stereotypes that circulate through mainstream and global cultures and how these influence interpersonal relationships and institutional practices. The course also investigates how artistic expression serves as a vehicle for identity, resilience, and community-building among older adults. This course seeks to develop the critical thinking skills that is needed in today\u2019s rapid changing cultural environments for older adults, and help students design meaningful arts-based interventions that enhance the lives of older populations."

Capstone project: The capstone project allows students to demonstrate the ability to use the knowledge, concepts, and methods acquired in the Global Affairs major in an innovative project that may involve research in literature or language, a portfolio of creative work, or an alternative that is approved by the program director. Internship: Students who decide to pursue a capstone internship will get the opportunity to apply their learning in a real-world environment. The experience will consist of an internship that will last at least 3 months. Internships have proven to be invaluable to students' career opportunities and effectiveness in the workplace. Students will be required to draw from their previous coursework to enhance their internship experience. The internship option includes a final paper that illustrates how learning from Global Affairs coursework has been effectively applied to real world practice."

Food literally connects our bodies to global history: what we eat now -  and why we eat it - result from centuries of unequal economic, political, and cultural interactions. Food also symbolizes the power relations that have shaped human identities, diets, and health over the last 500 years. Using scholarly writings, fiction, film, and field trips in the Boston area, we will explore how histories of empire and globalization have shaped contemporary foodways and the global politics of food provisioning today."

Major topics include Greco-Roman culture; the early development of Christianity and its impact on the ancient world; the evolution of new political and religious forms in the Middle Ages; the impact of the Renaissance and of European colonization in Africa, Asia, and the Americas; and the Protestant Reformation and Catholic responses to it. Europeans prior to 1600 established values and belief systems that they subsequently sought to impose through conquest, imperialism, missionary efforts, and trade. Thus, the ideas of this period have had an outsized impact on the United States and the world in the 21st century. The course includes critical examination of important primary sources."

In 200 CE, the Roman Empire was the largest, most diverse, and most powerful state the Mediterranean world had ever seen. By 500, the Western half of the Empire had splintered into smaller kingdoms that would eventually become the basis for modern European states. What happened? This course will examine the political, military, environmental, and social changes of the Empire as it loses territory and transforms into the medieval world. But we will spend just as much time trying to understand what it was like for typical Romans to live through this period. We will study armies and taxes, but also the rise of Christianity, the prevalence of slavery, the shifting gender norms, and the stories that filled the imaginations of people throughout this time. We will discuss major ancient cities like Rome and Constantinople, but we'll also venture out to the edges of the Empire and beyond learning about the Goths, Celts, Sassanians, and more.In addition to learning about the transformation of the Roman Empire between 250 and 800, students will also practice thinking like historians; that is, we will think about possibilities and limitations of the wide range of sources that historians use to piece together what happened and why it matters. How do we know what we know about the past? And why should we care how history is written?  ",

How did the subsequent revolutionary movement that promised social and economic equality transform into such a brutally oppressive system under Stalin? How did the Soviet Union become a world superpower and what were the reasons for its downfall? Through the use of primary documents, this course will attempt to answer these questions and emphasize social history: the ideals, aspirations, and actions of ordinary Soviet citizens.",

The first half of the course will focus on the films of the Weimar Republic - a time of bold artistic experimentation when Germany's film industry was second only to Hollywood in worldwide influence. The second half of the semester will be devoted to the cinema produced in Germany during the Nazi dictatorship, when movies were no longer simply entertainment, but also served as an important form of propaganda. The films of both of these periods will be analyzed as historical sources that illuminate the society that produced them.",

Self-assessment is a crucial aspect of the Honors College IS, as it is of the university-wide IS, and instructors are encouraged to develop self-assessment tools so that students may evaluate their growth as writers and also learn to recognize their strengths and areas for improvement. The Honors College Intermediate Seminar also requires students to use technology, for example, to access electronic databases for secondary material or construct a powerpoint slideshow for an in-class presentation. The Honors Intermediate Seminar exhibits a central feature of the Honors curriculum: interdisciplinary for content and pedagogy. Thus, and Honors intermediate seminar includes materials from different disciplines (the intermediate seminar on \"collecting\" for example, draws on readings from psychology, sociology, and history; the intermediate seminar on \"Baseball\" includes perspectives and analyses of the game from biology, physics, and history). Students are taught how to engage texts and data/information from multiple disciplines, and through the IS pedagogy, they are equipped with the skills to synthesize their understanding of concepts across disparate disciplines. Instruction might also include field trips to significant sites so that students can acquire hands-on experience with relevant materials and interact with practitioners in their work locations.

All human behavior, whether it is physical, social, or cognitive, comes into being through the processes of development. Developmental changes result from the interaction of various influences. These influences can range from the heredity prenatal environment to the broadest social and cultural factors. Basic concepts and theories are used to explain these life-long developmental changes. Familiarity and concepts and theories of development are essential tools of an effective human services worker. This course will examine life-span development and the role of the human service worker in helping individuals and families respond to the challenges in productive ways. Students will conduct field observations of a life stage and apply theory to explaining their behavior."

Case managers seek to support client self-determination but are also charged with controlling costs and rationing services posing ethical dilemmas for workers. We will examine best practice guidelines for case management and apply theory to practice in the field. We will examine case management from the perspective of the consumer, practitioner, other providers and the service system. A major focus of this class is critical examination of case management practice in a variety of settings.

Each participant has a role in understanding topics that are prevalent in the scientific community along with developing new information that might form the basic science investments of the future. This is a two-semester sequence, two credits each semester. Successful completion of the sequence will fulfill student's First-Year Seminar requirement. Course content will vary with instructor, but will focus on discussion of topics with broad societal impact, and will have important scientific underpinnings, with a particular focus on science topics. Using this approach, students will become increasingly familiar with and experienced in scientific discourse, the scientific method, and important new scientific findings. Desired outcomes will focus on student developing discovery skills, becoming self-driven learners, learning to work in groups and being successful at the university. This course will maximize students' potential for success in the university and the scientific community. There will be two major writing assignments with feedback on all submitted work. Grading will be based on class participation (Wiki's, class interactions), written papers, and an inquiry-based examination."

The class will investigate these and other aspects of Japanese food culture through written texts, visual arts, and film, in order to encourage a nuanced, complex, and critical understanding of the place of food in Japan.",

We will work to improve our skills in critical reading and writing. Lectures, readings, videos, and discussion explore the actions, opinions, identities, and experiences of diverse women and men.

It looks at migration historically, studying the reasons for fluctuations in the scale of migration (especially immigration to the United States) over time, and reasons for changes in the United States' degree of \"openness\" to immigrants. The course considers the conditions of work and life for immigrants themselves - including differences in conditions for different immigrant groups- as well as effects on people in the countries from which immigrants come. It looks at immigration restrictions not only in terms of their effects on the number of people entering the United States, but also in terms of their effects on the status and rights of people who live and work here. The course also looks seriously at the relationship between the conditions under which immigration takes place, on the one hand, and wages and conditions of work, on the other.

In this course, students will use case study methods to explore the various applications of organizing, methods of organizing and strategic approaches to organizing campaigns. The primary focus will be labor and labor/community organizing, but the course will be useful to any student who wishes to pursue organizing approaches to social justice."

Apuleius' novel tells the story of Lucius, a man driven by an insatiable curiosity to try to observe a witch perform magic, who, through a magical accident, finds himself turned into a donkey. Petronius' novel tells the story of two young lovers, Encolpius and Giton, and their wild adventures in the Greek cities of southern Italy. Readings will be in Latin; class discussion will be in either English or Latin.",

In this course, we will deal with the possibilities that Social Media can offer companies and how new e-services can be used to retain and interact with consumers. In this context, we rely partly on established theoretical models and best practice business cases. In particular, we consider network theory, community research, and studies regarding user-generated content for insight or the management of communities. Special attention will be given to mobile services as well as the special characteristics of social media.",

We will discuss Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its applications to data analysis. We will study linear transformations and change of basis. We will discuss complex vector spaces and Jordan canonical form of Matrices. We will discuss non-negative matrices and Perron-Frobenius Theory. We will explain multiple matrix factorisations, such as LU, QR, NMF. Finally we will discuss other applications such as the Fast Discrete Fourier Transform. For each of these topics we will discuss numerical computer algorithms and their implementations. In particular we will discuss in detail eigenvalue estimation, including iterative and direct methods, such as Hausholder methods, tri-diagonalzation, power methods, and power method with shifts. We will explain concepts of numerical analysis that are important to consider when we talk about the implementation of algorithms, such as stability and convergence. We will discuss iterative methods as well as direct ones, their advantages and disadvantages. The methods are their applications will be illustrated using a common programming language such as python and/or R.",

This automation is accomplished by writing small programs which are specific to the task at hand. These programs are best written in programming languages which are simple and flexible. This makes languages designed for large projects, such as Java and C++, unsuitable for this task.To meet this need, scripting languages such as Perl, Python, and PHP have been created. These languages are designed to be easier to learn than more demanding programming languages such as Java, C and C++.This course will teach the basics of scripting language and show students how it can be used to automate routine system administration and workflow tasks.",

Adult Health Nursing I is the study of comprehensive complex nursing care aimed at promotion, restoration and maintenance of health in adults. The lecture portion of the course emphasizes the impact of health problems and the interaction of the environment and access on diverse urban adult populations. Students refine and expand their knowledge through the application of the nursing process and the integration of knowledge, concepts and theories from nursing, sciences, and general education courses. The focus is on nursing interventions for selected adult patients whose quality of life is affected by deviations from health. The clinical practicum occurs within acute care settings and provides the student with experience in content application, collaboration and critical thinking. In addition, students enhance their communication and teaching/learning skills by assuming a leadership role in the seminar portion of the course.",

The primary objective of this course is to improve student ability to critically evaluate the arguments of others as well as to construct persuasive arguments of their own. Furthermore, students should leave the course with critical thinking tools that can be applied in nearly every area of study. To this end, the course will explore different forms of arguments, e.g., deductive and inductive arguments, the role of language in arguments and reasoning, numerical and probabilistic reasoning, cognitive and perceptual biases, the scientific method, and social aspects of critical thinking."

The following are the sorts of questions with which they were preoccupied, and upon which we focus in reading them: Is there a single ideal life which all human beings should strive to live-and if so, what does it consist in? What are the virtues that human beings should exemplify? Why should one live a moral life? Are there objective moral standards-and if so, how does one discover what they are? What roles do reason and the emotions, respectively, play in the moral life? Special attention is given to the role that one's metaphysical views and one's views of human nature play in shaping one's theory of ethics."

The course seeks to understand the mechanisms through which the political institutions and processes affect citizens, behaviors and political outcomes while comparing developing and developed countries. The third part of the course discusses political issues and policy outcomes including challenges to democracies, women and politics, social cleavages, and inequality and redistribution. Throughout the course, students will develop informed and coherent arguments on relevant topics through discussions, debates, simulation games, and research."

            "description": "For the past several decades, the world has witnessed a substantial increase in inequality. Two typical cases are the United States and China. The United States has had the highest level of inequality in the industrial world for the past few decades, and China has experienced dramatic increase in inequality and has become one of the most unequal countries in the world. This course will compare these two countries and will provide a broad overview of the causes and consequences of the rising inequality in the United States, China and globally. This course will also compare and analyze social and welfare policies in the United States, China and globally. The first part of the course will focus on the United States, the second part will focus on China, and the third part will look at inequality and redistributive policies comparatively and globally with a focus on the equal countries Sweden and Germany, and the unequal countries South Africa and Brazil. The topics we will cover include measurements and data of inequality; inequality in different aspects; causes of inequality; public opinions towards inequality; and the implications of rising inequality for democracy, autocracy and governance with a focus on redistributive policies. We will also touch on questions of why inequality should be studied in the first place - that is, why should anyone care about the growing gap between the rich and the poor; and what is the ideal level of inequality?"

This course emphasizes consideration of equity and disparities in health, building your understanding of how and why health disparities occur across the U.S. population, how to think about ethics related to both action and inaction in the face of health inequities, and what can be done to achieve health equity. We will explore questions such as, Why do Americans, on average, experience worse health and shorter lifespans than people in other developed countries? Why do some groups of Americans experience worse health and shorter lifespans than other groups? Is health and health care a \"right\"? and does every American actually have the same ability to pursue health and wellness as their fellow citizens do? What can we as a society do to reduce health disparities and promote health for every person in our country? What can we as individuals do to make sure we experience the best physical and mental health we can?",

The course explores a continuum of mental health, as well as contextual influences on psychological functioning and dysfunction. This course covers some of the material that was historically covered in our \"Abnormal Psychology\" course, and includes a critical analysis of the APA's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). While diagnoses are covered in the course, the course does not teach students how to diagnose others - to do so requires graduate level work.",

Therapeutic Mentoring is designed to give children and teens the opportunity for skill building through experiences that would naturally occur in their everyday life, at their home, foster home, childcare center, or other setting. To help the child develop a specified skill, their Therapeutic Mentor works to model, educate, motivate, and coach them on how to use and practice overcoming obstacles related to these skills.  Services are provided in any setting where the youth resides, such as the home (including foster homes and therapeutic foster homes), and in community settings, such as schools, child care centers, respite settings, as well as other culturally and linguistically appropriate community settings."

            "description": "This elective advanced course is designed to introduce students to approaches to inquiry that commonly are referred to as 'qualitative research.' While psychology historically has focused on experimental and quasiexperimental approaches to learning, increasingly psychologists are viewing these as only one approach to learning and embracing a wider variety approaches to building knowledge about people's lives and the societies within which they live. The course is designed to introduce students to some of these alternate ways of conducting research that are based on analyzing interviews and text. These methods are especially helpful in studying human experiences and actions (e.g., emotion, dialogue, psychotherapy), and in studying experiences of minorities and marginalized people. The course culminates in students' development of their own research proposals. The following are the course objectives: (1) To understand some of the historical and philosophical foundations for qualitative methods; (2) to become acquainted with a range of qualitative methods that are used in psychology; (3) to learn how to collect and analyze data; (4) to learn how to write a research proposal using APA format and understand how results are presented; and (5) to learn to evaluate qualitative research studies. They help to develop the skills of how to ask questions and seek out information that will guide you - skills that can transfer into many settings. Students have used their proposals as the basis for an honors thesis, as a proposal for research in their workplace, to apply for grants, and as writing samples for graduate studies. It is especially helpful for students who wish to complete a thesis or apply to graduate programs in the social sciences. These skills build from one class to the next so students need to commit to attending this class regularly.",

What do studies teach us about the important elements of thriving and well-being and what do these studies leave out? How can we promote well-being and thriving in ourselves and others without blaming individuals for contexts and situations that provide barriers? What do well-being and thriving look like in challenging contexts, turbulent times, and in the face of discrimination and inequity?",

We will examine how racism affects health across many dimensions, and why health disadvantages have persisted for people of color over time despite remarkable progress in medical care and medical interventions. Drawing on theory and broad research from public health, we will examine how structural racism in medical experimentation, residential segregation, incarceration, discrimination, education, and employment have created health inequalities that are a public health problem. This course will emphasize the important role of racism as a social determinant of health. Students will be encouraged to think critically about how to design public health interventions that prioritize social justice to achieve health equity."

In this course we will engage with the neighborhoods, culture, and people of the Boston area through primary data collection such as conducting interviews or participant observation. Using our sociological imaginations, we will draw on sociological theories and concepts to analyze data we have gathered and locate our data in the larger context of local, national, and global social structures. We will learn to use the library to locate scholarly resources as well as participate in activities that seek to improve writing skills in order to successfully complete the written portion of our research projects. These writing activities will include developing a research question or puzzle, constructing a thesis statement or argument, using scholarly research to support your arguments, explaining your methods for data collection, and effectively deploying theory or concepts to answer 'why' questions about your data. Through this engagement with the Boston area, we explore the careers students may pursue with a BA or higher degree in sociology. To this end, we will learn effective paths for completing a BA in sociology and learn about research that sociologists at UMass Boston are currently engaged in. Therefore, this course is designed for and open to declared sociology majors. Non sociology majors must receive instructor approval to join this course. Finally, we will work towards career planning by tackling practical concerns such as cover letter and resume writing.",

We leave a detective movie and start seeing the world as a series of clues; we leave a prayer meeting and start looking for moments of grace in daily life. This course serves as both an introduction to the methods and key terms in the study of religion and as a way to gain a richer understanding of why we watch films and how they work on us. We address topics such as: How do films such as Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" or Julie Dash's \"Daughters of the Dust\" organize the world through myths about good and evil and with rituals that bind communities across generations? How does the Coen brother's \"A Serious Man\" retell a Biblical story for the present? And how do Afro-futurist films such as Sun Ra's \"Space is the Place\" help viewers imagine world not structured by racism?"

            "description": "People have been trying to understand the fall of Rome since the fall of Rome. In 200 CE, the Roman Empire was the largest, most diverse, and most powerful state the Mediterranean world had ever seen. By 500, the Western half of the Empire had splintered into smaller kingdoms that would eventually become the basis for modern European states. What happened? This course will examine the political, military, environmental, and social changes of the Empire as it loses territory and transforms into the medieval world. But we will spend just as much time trying to understand what it was like for typical Romans to live through this period. We will study armies and taxes, but also the rise of Christianity, the prevalence of slavery, the shifting gender norms, and the stories that filled the imaginations of people throughout this time. We will discuss major ancient cities like Rome and Constantinople, but we'll also venture out to the edges of the Empire and beyond learning about the Goths, Celts, Sassanians, and more.In addition to learning about the transformation of the Roman Empire between 250 and 800, students will also practice thinking like historians; that is, we will think about possibilities and limitations of the wide range of sources that historians use to piece together what happened and why it matters. How do we know what we know about the past? And why should we care how history is written?  ",

This course explores a range of contemplative practices, mainly from Hindu, Buddhist, and/or Daoist traditions. We will also explore modern, secularized offshoots of these practices, such as mindfulness and postural yoga, which are now used widely in clinical settings and are the subject of much scientific research. The course will draw on perspectives such as the comparative study of religion, philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. Moreover, we will approach meditation both academically and experimentally: participants will study contemplative practices in their historical, cultural, and religious contexts, wand will likewise engage in the practice of mediation, in both traditional and modern varieties. Going beyond seated mediation, we will explore contemplative practices and the traditional creative arts (e.g. poetry and calligraphy); musical meditations; and contemplative body-mind practices (e.g. poetry and calligraphy); musical meditations; and contemplative body-mind practices (e.g. walking meditation, yoga, and/or Qi Gong). The course hence integrates conventional academic study with a unique form of experiential learning. Meditation practice is an essential component of the course.

Therefore, the program is structured around a series of assignments and milestones during which students will work with guidance from a faculty advisor and program coordinator toward a project that meets course goals.",

Naturally, the types of performance we find in various places and times demonstrate very different structures and functions, answering the particular needs of the cultures that created them. This course will survey the development of theatre from 1660 to the present. In addition to reading plays, we will consider such issues as the physical form of the stage, various approaches to acting, the changing constitution of audiences, and costume history, all with a mind to exploring the socio-historical forces that influenced the development of the theatre."

            "description": "This course examines the institutional setting of housing in the United States with a focus on moderate and low-income communities. Using a combination of historical, sociological, financial, and political economy perspectives, students will examine the role and interdependence of institutional actors in housing development. These institutional actors include different levels of governments, private for-profit corporations, and nonprofit organizations. Students will learn the approaches undertaken by different configuration of these institutional actors to address housing issues in a variety of political, economic, and social contexts. Finally, students will examine various housing issues (affordability, discrimination, gentrification, homelessness) and attempts to address these issues, paying particular attention to the ways that these issues differentially impact groups across lines of race, ethnicity, and socio-economic status."

By reading the stories of individuals and groups in these contexts, the course explores how socio-cultural notions of gender and sexuality, often deeply embedded among communities; perpetuate inequalities among South Asian subjects. It utilized life history, the novel, film, political critique and other literary genres to examine cultural and material foundations of inequality in contemporary South Asia, especially among women of particular religions, class, caste, and ethnicities.",

It explores narratives about how human family structures evolved, examines the increasing medicalization of reproduction and the body, and takes stock of the ways in which race, class, gender, and sexual orientation affect commonly held and frequently subscribed-to beliefs about what constitutes family. It illustrates the diversity of kinship definitions with ethnographic examples from the Iban of Indonesian Borneo, the Nyakyusa of East Africa, and other societies from the Americas, Africa, Asia, and the pacific Islands. Through an exploration of the pressures to which African American families have been subjected in the United States, it probes the ways in which the legacy of slavery shapes the possibilities and perceptions of contemporary families."

            "description": "Globalization is drawing increasing numbers of women (and men) into cross-border transactions in which the reproductive and sexual body is the desired object of exchange. These global markets raise important questions about what it means for human dignity when body parts and services are treated as commercially available. Do these transactions commodify women (particularly those from the Global South) by treating them as disposable, fragmentary bodies for the benefit of wealthy customers? Or do they offer new pathways out of poverty, by enabling women to assert control over this productive resource? Using a transnational feminist and human rights lens, this course examines these issues, with a particular focus on sex tourism/trafficking and gestational surrogacy. The course also looks at a very different type of cross-border travel - namely, the flight of persons in conflict zones for the purpose of escaping political violence rather than to seek or sell an intimate service. Specifically, we consider the unique challenges that refugees and internally displaced persons confront when seeking to access reproductive health services, including abortion."

This course explores concepts, theories, and histories of race, gender, and sexuality through the lens of mobility. Some of the core questions of this class include: How do constructions of race, gender, and sexuality inform, enable, or prevent people's freedom of movement and mobility in the modern world? While mobility between or within nations (immigration, travel, global trade) is romanticized as positive and liberating, what borders, bans, and walls impact the human rights of marginalized communities (ie refugees, migrant workers, queer and trans communities of color) to move freely? While this course investigates forms of structural oppression that limit mobility (including disability access, gender discrimination, and incarceration), we will also witness how self-narratives created by and for LGBTQ, immigrant, Black, Indigenous, and people of color communities work to transform individual and collective mobilities. Course texts include literature, films, and scholarship from interdisciplinary fields including gender and sexuality studies, cultural studies, geography, and ethnic studies. This course pays special attention to how formations of gender and sexuality intersect with the social categories of race, ability, and national belonging; it also considers how the universal human right to mobility is experienced differently based on one's intersectional identities of race, sexuality, gender, and class.",

Activists, artists, and theorists have mobilized queer of color critique to interrogate the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, class, nation, and diaspora as a response to the inherent whiteness of mainstream queer theory and persistent heterosexism in ethnic studies. Students will gain an understanding of queer of color critique as a humanistic method of inquiry that includes the analysis and interpretation of ideas and symbolic expression. We will examine the development of queer of color critique (primarily in the United States) through both academic and activist domains; consider what queer theory has to say about empire, citizenship, prisons, welfare, neoliberalism, and terrorism; and articulate the role of queer of color analysis in a vision for racial, gender, sexual, and economic justice.",

Drawing on a rich palette of interdisciplinary approaches, historical archaeology explores complex global processes such as colonization, industrialization, urbanization, and globalization. This course will focus on the methods employed by the field's practitioners, the various contexts in which this work is conducted, and the theoretical underpinnings of the field as a whole.",

Using the Americas as the geographical focus, the course devotes special attention to the analytical and theoretical discourse-shaping anthropological approaches to colonialism through the topics of material culture, gender, ideology, ethnicity, race, identity, labor, class, and resistance. Readings and discussions will draw on data and perspectives from ethnohistory, historical archaeology, and cultural anthropology to tackle the simultaneously global and local nature of colonialism.",

Functional behavior assessment procedures that will be covered include indirect assessments, descriptive assessments, and functional analysis. Student swill practice conduction an indirect and descriptive assessment, and have the opportunity to design a functional analysis. Treatments that will be covered include antecedent interventions, differential reinforcement procedures, extinction, and punishment, among others. Students will design a comprehensive function-based intervention plan. Conceptual and practical issues related to the assessment and treatment of challenging behavior will be addressed.",

Students will draw on interdisciplinary lenses, including contributions from psychological, sociological, anthropological and educational research, to understand and apply current perspectives on immigration to local contexts. Students will explore the implications of the growing presence of immigrant-origin students in public schools in the US and other post-industrial societies. The course will consider the role of gender, social-economic status, race, ethnicity, undocumented status and a variety of social context factors which affect the adaptation of immigrant students and families with special focus placed on education settings. Our evolving understanding of the pathways immigrant student take as they negotiate schooling and life in a new country will contribute to informed policy, curriculum and pedagogy choices."

As well, the relationship between language attitudes and educational policy formation will be studied. By the end of the course, students will demonstrate understanding of main issues in language policy and planning, and will articulate understanding of the complex factors that inform language planning decisions at local, state, and national levels. Finally, students are expected to leave the course well equipped with the core analytical skills needed to engage in research on LPP, including data collection, analysis, and presentation."

The first of three sections will identify an environmental problem such as global warming, ozone depletion, or water pollution. The second section will look at real-world implications of Green Chemistry-for example, from a manufacturing, toxicological, or economic perspective. The third section will present an array of representative topics: renewable energy, atmospheric chemistry, chemical reactions in water and soil, or benign chemical syntheses, for example. Combined, the three sections provide an understanding of chemistry designed to benefit society and provide pathways to minimize environmental impact.",

This course explores various approaches to understanding sex and sexuality in the counseling hour. Students will discuss and analyze historical approaches to issues of sexual function, dysfunction, intimacy, and sexual identity in individuals and couples and families (and to some extent societies). We focus on healthy sexuality but also integrate theory and practice around victimization and sex offending. Students will examine their own sexual histories and understand their own values, biases and assumptions regarding sexuality and sexual functioning, and the potential impact of these issues on their ability to become effective, compassionate therapists."

It will provide students with an overview of the medications used for treating mental disorders. The basic principles of pharmacology and the interrelationships between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will also be addressed. The emphasis is on practical and clinical application. Special topics will include: the nature of alcohol and narcotics and the ways they affect addicts in mind and body before, during, and after treatment as well as psychopharmacological treatment for addictions; informed consent; how to find accurate and balanced information about the efficacy and side effects of psychotropic medications; how to educate my clients about the medications they are taking; how to collaborate with prescribing providers and other mental health professionals. Students will also become conversant with regulatory standards for the approval of new medications. Social justice and bioethical issues will figure predominately in this course with reference to for-profit IRB's, recruitment of marginalized groups such as undocumented immigrants, the homeless, and people living in poverty, and discrepancies in prescription practices.",

Students will also be introduced to structural equation modeling (SEM), hierarchical linear modeling/multilevel modeling (HLM/MLM), and generalized linear models, although deeper understanding of these models will be outside the scope of this course. The course will be hands-on, meaning that students will be required to conduct the above analyses using appropriate statistical software."

Though this is not a creative writing course that makes use of workshop, students will be asked to write both a traditional analytical essay as well as a work of fiction, a story or extended scene, in the style of one of the authors we will be discussion during the semester."

The project will include an analysis of relevant, critical literature along with the development of an appropriate, meaningful intervention to address the issue. This intervention may involve, for example, an organizing initiative, the planning of a program, the design of a training curriculum or the proposal for a research project. Students participate in a weekly Capstone Seminar led by a faculty member, and will also be mentored by a capstone advisor. Those students seeking to go on to a PhD program will be advised to pursue a research-based capstone project. In addition, the Capstone Seminar provides participants with an opportunity to review and reflect on their work in the TCCS Master's program and its impact on their current and future professional and personal lives. In sharing their process and products with each other throughout the semester, students will be able to demonstrate knowledge and integration of skills, process, and strategies of transdisciplinary thinking and grounded, local/global, reflective practice. Capstone projects will be presented by and for seminar participants, together with public audiences, as appropriate, during the final third of the semester."

Students spend one day a week in a PreK-2nd grade public school classroom where they start observing and incrementally taking responsibilities. From helping one single student to small group monitoring, the experience leads to the teaching of a lesson to the whole class that is assessed by the university supervisor. Such assessment is discussed with each individual student and a plan to identify areas and strategies for improvement is completed."

In the first four weeks of the semester students will be introduced to some core issues in development Economics. these topics will provide the basic framework for the remainder of the course.  In the second part of the course, which constitutes the bulk, students will have an opportunity to engage with a specific topic in greater depth. this topic will vary with the instructor teaching the course. Topics include: Urbanization in Developing countries, Poverty and Inequality, Structural Change and Transformation, Gender and development, War, Macroeconomic Issues in Developing Countries, and Political Economy of Development. Whichever the area, students will be given the skills necessary to critically analyze the process of economic development, to identify the winners and losers in this process, and to appreciate what would constitute just and sustainable policy in that area.",

Using principles of Universal Design of Learning (UDL), Multicultural Education, and Linguistically Relevant Pedagogy, we will identify and apply appropriate strategies to design and modify curriculum, instructional materials, and assessment for students with moderate disabilities in general education classroom environments. Grounded in Narrative Inquiry, participants will examine various perceptions of disability and diversity; study the historical and legal foundations of inclusion; interrogate the misrepresentation of culturally and linguistically diverse students in special education; design inclusive, academically rigorous, culturally and linguistically responsive environments for all students; and develop and reflect on their philosophy of inclusion. Students will anchor their analysis of these issues on a pedagogy of equity, diversity, and transformation by applying the framework of intersectionality. Through Backwards Design Planning, Team-Based Learning, the Jig-Saw classroom, reflective teaching, and digital storytelling we will investigate the intersections among various social categories -- among them ability, language, culture, race, and socioeconomic status -- and explore how we can promote inclusive and equitable educational practices for all learners."

This include selecting developmentally appropriate reading materials and composition activities for a range of learners; identifying prerequisite skills, concepts, and vocabulary necessary for content-specific learning activities; and determining which strategies best meet particular content learning objectives. In doing so, techniques for incorporating new technologies into teaching as well as the legal and ethical challenges for both teachers and students will be examined."

The purpose of this course is to prepare the Commonwealth's teachers with the knowledge and skills to effectively shelter their content instruction so that our growing population of English language learners (ELLs) can access curriculum, achieve academic success, and contribute their multilingual and multicultural resources as participants and future leaders in the 21st century global economy. This course debunks notions of linguistic deficit and explore avenues to support multilingual students in the construction of knowledge and skills in the content areas. Participants will engage in the reflective and interactive design of instruction that integrates the WIDA (ELD) standards with Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks, exploring and implementing strategies to teach multilingual learners to read and write in the content areas."

            "description": "This required course, taken in the first spring semester, helps participants develop a diverse set of perspectives for analyzing organizations. Practitioners who are interested in leadership roles in schools and other urban educational settings function in a variety of roles in many large and small organizations: teachers and classroom administrators in buildings or programs, members of a department or team, students in a graduate classroom, union members and leaders, parents of school-aged children and part of a school community. Practitioners also play roles in organizations outside of schools-in community groups, sports teams, religious groups, etc. The course helps look at those organizations and the roles played within them, by offering a broad set of perspectives drawn from the extensive literature on organizations. Learning to understand and use multiple perspectives for analyzing organizations allows us to reflect on our roles in them, even as it expands the set of possible choices for taking action and leadership within them."

For example, what happened when printing press technology made books inexpensive and readily available to a buying public? The course will also analyze the way \"history of the book\" studies are being transformed due to the digital reproduction of archival materials. What does it mean to interact with a rare book online? In addition, as the course examines rare books and manuscripts, students will uncover the role of the literary scholar and his/her ability to shape the form given to the literary work. What happens to a rare book when it is edited for publication?"

            "description": "This graduate seminar examines literary translation and interpretation, concentrating on both poetry and prose.  Translators can be viewed as artists working between one language and another, recreating texts.  The course will focus on the practice, theory, and craft of literary translation, with particular attention given to close reading interpretation.  Students will produce translations of texts of their own choice.  Knowledge of second language is recommended, but not required to take the course.  Students without knowledge of a second language will have the opportunity to produce translations of texts written in middle or old English, or in dialect of English.  Readings will include classic and recent essays on translation theory, as well as excerpts from a selection of variant sample translations.  Attention will also be given to how the practice of translation has influenced the work of many well-known writers, from Elizabeth Bishop, Seamus Heaney and W. S. Merwin to Robert Pinsky and H. D.  Without translation, a critical activity that connects otherwise separate languages and cultures, readers and writers would be left in relative isolation, unaware of wider trends in world literature.  With thousands of languages used worldwide, all of us, even multilingual readers, are ultimately dependent on the work of translators to read more widely.  Translation is a fascinating area of study that presents stimulating possibilities for creative writers."

In the case of creative writing theses, approval by the Director of Creative Writing is also required. The student works under the supervision of a faculty thesis director in regular tutorial conferences. Students should begin working on their project a full semester before the semester in which the project is due. The thesis will be read by a committee of three graduate faculty members who will judge its suitability as partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Master of Arts degree. Finally, a thesis defense before the student's committee and open to all members of the English Department will take place."

The course focuses on gaining experience reading peer reviewed scientific literature, and understanding how research is used to guide physical activity programs and policies. This course provides an overview of the epidemiological evidence on associations between physical activity and a variety of health outcomes with an emphasis on chronic cardio-metabolic disease and cancer, key determinants of physical activity behaviors in different populations, and effective approaches for increasing participation in physical activity. Special attention is given to developing critical thinking skills and understanding the application of epidemiological methods to the science of physical activity and health outcome. The class is also structures to provide opportunities for in-depth analysis and discussion as to how various research methods are used to study physical activity."

This experiential course, which can be field- or laboratory-based, and located on site at UMass Boston or off-campus, provides an opportunity for students to apply relevant clinical, communications and management skills. The practicum is designed to support students' translation of knowledge acquired in prior EHS courses to actual skill-based practice. In close consultation with the course instructor and major advisor, the student is placed in an EHS department-approved site to complete a minimum of 100 hours of experience. In addition, the student attends a class meeting once per month. The classroom meetings provide a forum for students to reflect on and assess their practicum learning experiences with their course instructor and peers. Discussion extends beyond the student's skill practicum experience to include on-going evaluation or re-evaluation of career goals.",

The goal is to increase students' understanding of the range of approaches and strategies that these organizations use to respond to pressing societal issues (such as human rights, health and disability, women's and children's welfare, education, refugee and disaster relief) and crises (such as war, hunger, poverty, natural disaster, genocide) but also of the impact that these issues and crises can have on cross-cultural communities, vulnerable population, and social inclusion. A particular emphasis is placed on the non-governmental sector and its role in addressing immediate and long-term issues and crisis and in promoting the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In this course students will learn how to interpret the world of opinion, ethics, judgment , need, and urgency as it is driven by what is known and what is transmitted. They will realize the importance of communication, public awareness and understanding of ethical and moral concerns and how these interrelate with social inclusion at all levels."

            "description": "Ethical issues are prevalent in multiple contexts. At the personal level, ethics may determine how we choose to interact with others; within organizations, ethics may influence the strategies used to reach organizational goals; nationally, ethics can have a role in determining priorities and shaping the policy agenda; and at the global level, ethics may often determine the quality of relationships and degree of cooperation between international bodies. Ethical competence by individuals, organizations, and nations requires that one's conduct be congruent with generally accepted moral principles and values. This course introduces students to ethical theory and how ethics are shaped by values, as well as ethical standards and codes that guide professional practice and conduct in global inclusion and social development. The course also teaches students strategies and techniques to identify and help address ethical issues in practice, research, and evaluation in a variety of contexts (local, regional, national, global, cross-national) and settings (health, disability, community development, cross-cultural). Students in the master's and doctoral programs in global inclusion and social development can choose to take this course or the Cultural Competency: Impacts on Innovations and Model Development course."

The emphasis is on field-based qualitative research methods and data gathering techniques for doctoral and master's students to use in challenging settings on key governance, health, development and related concerns, especially (but not only) in the developing countries. A primary objective and output of the course is for students to develop a field-based research proposal that frames a social research problem; and more clearly defines the research design and accompanying research methods -to advance the students' thinking/work on their master's or dissertation proposal, while thinking through key aspects of the field research portion of their research. Principles, practice, debates and ethics concerns are also covered in the course."

It addresses both normal aging and psychopathology. Of special concern is the question of whether there are any systematic intrinsic psychological or personality changes associated with development in later life. The course also focuses on the processes used to cope with age-associated transitions ranging from the empty nest to impending death. It explores theoretical models for understanding coping and adaptation, developmental changes, and psychopathology. Other topics include clarification of the causes and nature of the most common psychopathologies, depression, and Alzheimer's disease; and the psychodynamics of institutionalization and family care of the very old."

Decisions about programs and services will need to be made with innovation, forethought and deliberation, decisions that need to be based on law and ethics. How should limited resources be offered to this growing elder population? Will they be allocated, and how? Is allocation ethical? And, as society moves forward, how will other changes impact elders?

The course gives an opportunity for students to critically consider their own research interests in light of qualitative inquiry, design and conduct a small-scale research study reflecting those research interests, and read and interpret both theoretical and research literature on qualitative methods. In addition, during the course, students will have a range of opportunities to reflect on and question their own assumptions about the nature of knowledge and knowledge creation through qualitative research.",

They will explore successful models of interpretation in public venues and examine dilemmas in community collaboration and interpretation for and with the public. Students examine the roles of evidence, history and politics in interpretation; venues, cultures and histories that shape interpretation; interpretive methods and practices in using historical evidence in public history venues; and issues and practices that challenge the practice of public history now and into the future. The course offers students several opportunities to engage in this exploration through readings, assignments, class discussion, guest speakers, case studies, visits to actual and virtual sites, written and oral assignments, and practicum experiences with a community partner."

The students will be given close supervision by a UMB History Department faculty member and will be required to meet the same requirement as graduate students meet in laboratories. In other words, the three-credit internship will require 2.5 hours of work per week, per credit, or a total of 7.5 hours of intern work per week. In the process of the internship, students will learn from public history practitioners such as museum professionals, tour guides, re-enactors, documentary film makers as well as from scholars of history. These practitioners will guide students through the problems and solutions involved in planning and funding public history projects as well as the problems in selecting, conducting and oral and community history projects and interpreting and presenting historical information in various venues in order to engage and educate public audiences."

In most scientific modeling projects, investigators have to deal with very large systems of linear equations, understanding of which requires powerful computers, and a firm understanding of the vast number of existing pertinent algorithms. The main goal of the course is to provide an introduction to algorithmic and mathematical foundations of high-performance matrix computations.  Topics include linear algebraic systems, the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix and some of its modern applications. We will discuss Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its applications to data analysis. We will study linear transformations and change of basis. We will discuss complex vector spaces and the Jordan canonical form of Matrices. We will discuss non-negative matrices and Perron-Frobenius Theory. We will explain multiple matrix factorizations, such as LU, QR, NMF. For each of these topics we will discuss numerical computer algorithms and their implementations. In particular we will discuss in detail eigenvalue estimation, including iterative and direct methods, such as Hausholder methods, tri-diagonalization, power methods, and power methods with shifts. We will explain concepts of numerical analysis that are important to consider when we talk about the implementation of algorithms, such as stability and convergence. We will discuss iterative methods as well as direct ones, their advantages and disadvantages. The methods and their applications will be illustrated using a common programming language such as python and/or R. The course will emphasize mathematical and software engineering methods that will allow students to fully participate at all levels of algorithm design and implementation.",

The course is divided roughly into two parts that deal with macroeconomic and microeconomic issues. In the macro section such key aggregates as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, inflation rate, and balance of payments, which are of importance to the firm manager, are discussed. Discussions focus on a critical examination of how these aggregates are measured and determined in various competing theoretical models. The theory discussed here then serves as an analytical tool in understanding and evaluating economic policies related to such current economic issues as unemployment, inflation, and trade imbalances. In the micro section, emphasis is given to a) the theory of markets, how prices and quantities are determined in markets and factors that affect these prices and quantities; and b) how firms compete in different market environments. Besides concentrating on the theory, special attention is given to how the concepts covered are applied to real-world microeconomic problems.",

In order to ensure the bright future of the accounting profession, we must use technology to its full advantage. In this course students will gain a basic understanding of AIS in the areas of 1) Information Systems, 2) AIS Applications, 3) Database Concepts, 4) Internal Control, 5) Data Analytics and 6) Auditing of AIS. In this course we will supplement lectures with active learning and group work in order to make class fun and interesting while we learn! Students will complete various software assignments to gain exposure to modern technologies. This is not a computer or technology course - it is a business and information course in which you will later apply theoretical concepts learned using computers.",

Students build skills in seeing increasingly complex patients with a combination of higher risk, acute illness, and chronic health problems where atypical disease presentation and challenges to disease treatment exist.  Seminars are grounded in learning the application of theory and research to the domains of practice of the adult/gerontological nurse practitioner including the management of patient health and illness, the teaching-coaching function of the nurse practitioner, and ensuring the quality of health care services.  Interdisciplinary collaborative practice skills are developed.  Students develop role competencies under the supervision of nurse practitioner or physician preceptors and faculty in a variety of health care settings.  Seminar discussions include an exploration of special topics in disease management to improve quality, access and cost of primary health care for diverse populations (or communities) with an emphasis on underserved populations, where diversity includes age, gender, race/ethnicity, culture, religion, language, sexual orientation, abilities, and socioeconomic status.",

Students will formulate coherent philosophical, theoretical, conceptual, and methodological understandings in their appraisal of knowledge gained from previous coursework. Considerations for new inquiry that advance nursing science and health sciences will be explored. Conducting an effective and comprehensive review of the literature or policy analysis from conceptual and methodological perspectives will also be emphasized. This course is designed to give doctoral students opportunities to engage classmates and professors in dialogue and discussion about integrating concepts and methods into the process of research development. Students should take advantage of this opportunity to build their research community by engaging fully in class discussion with fellow students and faculty."

Fundamental questions include: What are the relations between developmental changes in the brain (e.g. morphology, connectivity) and developmental changes in children's perceptual and cognitive abilities (e.g. depth perception, ability to sustain selective attention, executive functions)? Why, and how, is learning enhanced during certain periods in development? These issues will be investigated in the context of the following specific topics: the development of the visual system, visual attention, memory, executive functions, speech and language. The methods of human cognitive neuroscientific research that can be used with infants and children will also be discussed (e.g. ERP, NIRS)."

Close attention is paid to the negotiation of the therapeutic alliance, particularly in relation to self-interruptive or defensive moments when clients back away from important or threatening issues. It teaches specific interventions such as focusing, gestalt chairwork, evocative unfolding, and problematic reaction point exercises. The weekly format of the course will entail one hour of lecture and two hours of supervised exercises and discussion.

Particular attention is paid to the way these inequalities shape the notions of citizenship as well as employment.

Together we will engage contemporary social theory, considering how it helps us explain data-driven findings, shapes the practice of sociology today, and influences our imaginings about other social worlds and disciplinary forms that might be possible. Particular theorists or traditions will be selected for study according to the interests of the instructor."

The Graduate Research Seminar is designed to guide MA and PhD students through the process of producing an empirical research paper from beginning to end, including developing a unique research question that is grounded in the existing literature, answering your question through the analysis of quantitative or qualitative data, and communicating your findings to a relevant audience. In this intensive 6.0 credit course, the overarching research project will be scaffolded through assignments that ask you to engage with and build on these steps while integrating feedback from your instructors and peers along the way. The objective is for your final paper to be used for purposes beyond SOCIOL 694 course requirements and to serve as a building block in your larger research agenda. For MA students, the final paper must be accepted by the two instructors to fulfill the capstone requirement for the MA degree. Doctoral students may use the course to prepare for the Empirical Paper Comprehensive Exam. Please note that students need a background in quantitative and/or qualitative research methods prior to enrolling in this course.",

            "description": "This seminar aims to provide students with a deeper knowledge of human rights as both an intellectual discourse and a realm of political action. The first part of the course deals with the emergence and institutionalization of human rights in the 20th century. Beginning with an overview of its roots in political theory, moving to the first and second generation of rights, to debates over universality and cultural relativism and ending with exploration of human rights frameworks' applicability and implications across nations and cultures, the course offers an in-depth interdisciplinary understanding of the field and its practices. Topics of study include torture, genocide, race gender and law, visual culture, humanitarian intervention and protection."

            "description": "This course investigates theories and practices of feminist inquiry across a range of disciplines. Doing feminist research involves rethinking disciplinary assumptions and methodologies, developing new understandings of what counts as knowledge, seeking alternative ways of understanding the origins of problems/issues, formulating new ways of asking questions and redefining the relationship between subjects and objects of study. The course will focus on methodology, i.e., the theory and analysis of how research should proceed. We shall be especially attentive to epistemological issues--pre-suppositions about the nature of knowledge and in their connections to methodologies and research methods. Further, we shall explore how these connections are formed in the traditional disciplines and raise questions about why they are inadequate and / or problematic for feminist inquiry."
