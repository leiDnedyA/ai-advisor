It reads these writers as responding to canonical representations of blackness through their own insistent presentations of the racial past and its possible futures, through their remaking of the literary genres of the canon that help generate representations of blackness, and through their reimagining of the very category of Black womanhood in new, more expansive and liberating ways. Authors include Toni Morrison, Gloria Naylor, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Jesmyn Ward, Helen Oyeyemi, Virginia Woolf, Rivers Solomon, and Octavia Butler.",

What can the evolution of the genre tell us about the ways in which American ideas about power, politics, morality, and heroism have changed over the past eighty-five years? This course offers an in-depth, interdisciplinary analysis of diverse representations of superheroes in historical context. Through lecture, class discussion, papers, and presentations, students will gain a greater understanding of how the superhero story reflects and perhaps even shapes American culture."

While work and organized labor receive central attention, the course gives equal consideration to the comparative dimensions of class and cultural identity, race and gender, immigration and ethnicity, family and community, technology, politics, and government policy. We will work to improve our skills in critical reading and writing. Lectures, readings, videos, and discussion explore the actions, opinions, identities, and experiences of diverse women and men. You will work on understanding and interpreting the materials. Short essays, in-class exams, and presentation will provide opportunities to develop your interpretations systematically and polish your writing skills."

This course examines the archaeology of the societies behind the Viking raids from their origins in Late Iron Age Scandinavia, to their expansion into Europe and the British Isles, and on to the discovery of North America and the colonization of Greenland. In addition to covering the archaeology and history of Viking Age societies, the course presents and critically evaluates several anthropological themes which have been exemplified by Norse society: the Germanic mode of production, gift exchange and reciprocity, proto-world systems, gender and class identity, pagan religious systems and mythology, the archaeology of religious conversion, and cultural contact in the preindustrial world."

It explores narratives about how human family structures evolved, examines the increasing medicalization of reproduction and the body, and takes stock of the ways in which race, class, gender, and sexual orientation affect commonly held and frequently subscribed-to beliefs about what constitutes family. It illustrates the diversity of kinship definitions with ethnographic examples from the Iban of Indonesian Borneo, the Nyakyusa of East Africa, and other societies from the Americas, Africa, Asia, and the pacific Islands. Through an exploration of the pressures to which African American families have been subjected in the United States, it probes the ways in which the legacy of slavery shapes the possibilities and perceptions of contemporary families."

All these religious practitioners use their skills to achieve direct communication with the spiritual realm. The course focuses on the shamanism that is integral to many indigenous religions, and how it aims to fortify relations between humans and the spiritual world in order to validate cultural knowledge, regulate human relations with the natural environment, diagnose and heal human suffering, and build community solidarity."

In this course we deconstruct familiar discourses about things through an examination of the world of material possessions, places, people, ideas, and space in cross-cultural perspective. Our aim is to gain more nuanced understanding about the apparent human tendency to create our identities through assigning personal and cultural significance to objects around us. Course readings will be drawn primarily from anthropology, art history, art criticism, cultural studies, and curatorial/museum studies. We will also share our observations, experiences, and reflections of particular object worlds through museum site visits, class discussions, and individual projects. Our own milieu of the Western museums will offer valuable case studies about the historical and political implications of particular histories of collecting, classifying, displaying, and interpreting the wider world as a collection of objects."

In this course, the arts are our lens onto the diverse experiences of people of African descent, including how Black people live their histories of movement and also have responded to and resisted racial oppression as they have been rooted and routed across space and time. The course examines different forms of art (primarily visual and performing arts), what they mean to artists producing them, how they are categorized in institutions and communities, and how they illuminate ways of anchoring community and identity to place. The course takes us comparatively across global, national, and local (Boston) spaces in order to illuminate how people(s) use arts to express aesthetic, moral, spiritual, and philosophical dimensions of what it means to be human. The overall approach is drawn from Anthropology - the science of the study of culture - but we also draw from analyses in history, art history, activism, and community development/empowerment. Geographic areas covered include Africa, North America, and the Caribbean."

The course addresses such concepts as elements of composition, rhythm, symmetry, and space; and the possibilities of differing interpretations of subject matter.

In this course we deconstruct familiar discourses about things through an examination of the world of material possessions, places, people, ideas, and space in cross-cultural perspective. Our aim is to gain more nuanced understanding about the apparent human tendency to create our identities through assigning personal and cultural significance to objects around us. Course readings will be drawn primarily from anthropology, art history, art criticism, cultural studies, and curatorial/museum studies. We will also share our observations, experiences, and reflections of particular object worlds through museum site visits, class discussions, and individual projects. Our own milieu of the Western museums will offer valuable case studies about the historical and political implications of particular histories of collecting, classifying, displaying, and interpreting the wider world as a collection of objects."

At the same time, historicist, academic, and period-specific trends were crucially important aspects of visual culture. This class focuses on the dual tendencies of tradition and progress that define the nineteenth century through a survey of its artistic, visual, and material culture. The discussion of specific artistic trends will be framed by an examination of the social and political climate in which they were created.",

It employs literature and film to focus on culture and society in South Asia. It specifically addresses gender, as a form of social and historical inequality in South Asia, which is home to diverse socio-cultural communities, which are further divided from within by languages, class, religious affiliations, and regional differences. By reading the stories of individuals and groups in these contexts, the course explores how socio-cultural notions of gender and sexuality, often deeply embedded among communities; perpetuate inequalities among South Asian subjects. It utilized life history, the novel, film, political critique and other literary genres to examine cultural and material foundations of inequality in contemporary South Asia, especially among women of particular religions, class, caste, and ethnicities.",

This course explores a range of contemplative practices, mainly from Hindu, Buddhist, and/or Daoist traditions. We will also explore modern, secularized offshoots of these practices, such as mindfulness and postural yoga, which are now used widely in clinical settings and are the subject of much scientific research. The course will draw on perspectives such as the comparative study of religion, philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. Moreover, we will approach meditation both academically and experimentally: participants will study contemplative practices in their historical, cultural, and religious contexts, wand will likewise engage in the practice of mediation, in both traditional and modern varieties. Going beyond seated mediation, we will explore contemplative practices and the traditional creative arts (e.g. poetry and calligraphy); musical meditations; and contemplative body-mind practices (e.g. poetry and calligraphy); musical meditations; and contemplative body-mind practices (e.g. walking meditation, yoga, and/or Qi Gong). The course hence integrates conventional academic study with a unique form of experiential learning. Meditation practice is an essential component of the course.

Over the course of two-week modules, we will delve into comprehending a new function of business and discover how these principles apply and become relevant in real-world business environments through an integrated course project to which each student contributes:  a social impact business plan. The social impact business plan is a strategic document that outlines how a business intends to address a social or environmental challenge, while maintaining financial viability. We add to these practical areas an understanding of the contexts in which business operates - law, government, society, rapidly changing technology, new risks, the changing nature of careers, increasingly diverse workforces, and the broad global reach of business. This course will develop your capabilities in reading and critical thinking, oral and written communication, working in teams, information technology, academic self-assessment, and professional etiquette.",

            "description": "People have been trying to understand the fall of Rome since the fall of Rome. In 200 CE, the Roman Empire was the largest, most diverse, and most powerful state the Mediterranean world had ever seen. By 500, the Western half of the Empire had splintered into smaller kingdoms that would eventually become the basis for modern European states. What happened? This course will examine the political, military, environmental, and social changes of the Empire as it loses territory and transforms into the medieval world. But we will spend just as much time trying to understand what it was like for typical Romans to live through this period. We will study armies and taxes, but also the rise of Christianity, the prevalence of slavery, the shifting gender norms, and the stories that filled the imaginations of people throughout this time. We will discuss major ancient cities like Rome and Constantinople, but we'll also venture out to the edges of the Empire and beyond learning about the Goths, Celts, Sassanians, and more.In addition to learning about the transformation of the Roman Empire between 250 and 800, students will also practice thinking like historians; that is, we will think about possibilities and limitations of the wide range of sources that historians use to piece together what happened and why it matters. How do we know what we know about the past? And why should we care how history is written?  ",

This course will discuss and examine how we develop gender identities (and how these identities differ from biological sex), how this identity is shaped through the messages we receive from a number of communication systems (family, education, media, etc.), and how our gender identities in turn influence our communication patterns. As we go through the course, we'll examine various masculine and feminine roles and stereotypes, and the impact of gender stereotypes on communication. We will also consider the limitations of gender binaries, and explore a diverse array of gender identification and expression."

We foreground how racial, ethnic, socioeconomic class, and gender groups experience ecological disasters intensified by climate change. In addition to examining the disproportionate impact on low-income, communities of color, and Indigenous peoples, we will examine how these communities are leading resistance to ecological disasters and environmental violence. We will examine the power dynamics of environmental issues via media and film, journalism, public relations, advertising, rhetoric, and public participation and activism to understand how communication can create a more just and sustainable world. Students will interpret and analyze the voices of individuals and groups struggling to define major environmental topics, such as: climate change and pollution, energy, water, food and agriculture, biodiversity and extinction, ocean life, wilderness habitat, war, and consumerism.",

These students may want to learn the current language of CS 110, or may be interested in the material of CS 110 as a means of preparing for the follow-up course, which is CS 210. Such students can, with permission of the department, register for CS 119 for two credits. They then make arrangement to attend a section of CS 110. They are required to do all the assignments, examinations, etc., of regular CS 110 students. Thus, in virtually all respects, students who register for CS 119 are really CS 110 students, except that CS 119 meets no core curriculum requirement and does not count towards any computer science major requirement."

            "description": "Hip Hop dance will teach the fundamentals of hip hop and how to put them together in routines. The dance form involves ''a complex array of interlocking rhythms, percussive accents of isolated body parts popping out in unexpected phrasing,'' (Andre Lepecki, ed., Of the Presence of the Body, 2004). Key figures in its early development in the 1970's are Afrika Baambata, a rapper who is credited with forming the first group of hip hop dancers, and DJ Kool Herc of Jamaican origin who brought his two turntables to the block parties in the South Bronx. Its influences range from African dance and Brazilian Capoeira to James Brown, Michael Jackson and, more recently, music videos. This course covers the variety of components that make up Hip Hop Dance: poppin', lockin', wavin', steppin', top rockin', and downrockin' and basic breakin'. The course material will help students develop strength, coordination and a strong mental focus while they thoroughly enjoy moving themselves to the lively rhythms of hip hop music. This is a practical course in which the great majority of time will be spent practicing dance technique and choreography. While we may occasionally view a video, most of our time will be spent actually dancing. We will become familiar with basic Hip Hop moves and practice putting these moves into combination in challenging ways. We will further enhance our knowledge of Hip Hop through the writing of two papers. Material learned in class will prepare us for an end-of-semester studio performance."

This course is organized around three primary sets of questions within the field of urban economics. The first focuses on the development of urban areas. Why do cities exist and why do some grow more rapidly? The second area addresses patterns of development within metropolitan areas. How do firms and households decide where to locate within given metropolitan areas? What determines the price of land, and how do these prices vary across space? The third and final area concerns the spatial dimensions of urban problems. Specifically, we will examine poverty, housing, and congestion. In addition to a rigorous study of urban economic theory, this course will also include a team based consulting project for a specific client in the city of Boston. Students will receive their client at the beginning of the semester and will conduct original empirical research to address their client's concerns.",

Slowly you remember being ambushed in your lab and being knocked out by a large person with a chair. ''They must be trying to get my new invention,'' you think. You suspected that once word got out, villains would want to get their hands on this powerful new tool, you just didn't think it would happen this quickly. You know you must prevent them at all costs. After all, whoever controls this new technological invention can rule the world. Your mission is to save the world, that is in the context of the game story in this class. To do so, you are not expected to begin with any coding skills but must learn basic coding concepts such as debugging, looping, and Boolean logic to solve a series of problems embedded within this game story in order to advance the storyline. Designed like a video game, it is an asynchronous online course that can be completed at your own pace. By the end of the class, you will code your own interactive game using a block-based programming language. This class is intended for any undergraduate student in any program who is interested in learning to code."

            "description": "The Perspective on Science and Mathematics course explores a selection of topics and episodes in the history of science and mathematics. You will understand that these disciplines are not merely a body of facts, theories, and techniques. rather, they involve diverse processes by which knowledge is continually generated and reformulated.Sciences typically discussed in Perspectives include biology, physics, geology, astronomy, and chemistry. The course traces the development of key notions in these sciences and seeks to correct common myths or defective portrayals of history in science textbooks. We will also discuss the question of whether mathematics is itself a science. The course provides historical perspectives on how practical needs, social conflicts, and even individual personalities shaped the content and direction of the disciplines.An additional objective of the course is to convey that scientific and mathematical concepts are not static. The goal of the course is to promote among UTeach students the understanding that even the most basic ideas of science and mathematics are dynamic, despite the way this information is presented in K-12 textbooks."

The RETELL initiative comes at a time when teachers of all students, and teachers of multilingual learners (MLLs) in particular, must be equipped to address the needs and build on the assets of a diverse and ever- changing student population in Massachusetts. The introduction of various educational reforms requires teachers to assume new roles and responsibilities in their classrooms.

Through the study of theories of writing, students in Composition I gain knowledge of core key concepts, including audience, purpose, and genre, which help them understand writing as a rhetorical meaning-making activity that responds to situations and generates new perspectives. Through cycles of writing, feedback, revision, and reflection, students advance their ability to develop informed, critical perspectives and articulate claims in dialogue with complex texts. Students gain rhetorical awareness by composing texts that account for audience expectations for language and genre and reflecting on their own writing and learning. The flexible, adaptable writing knowledge and practices developed in Composition I are designed to facilitate students' self-reflective writing in other contexts.",

            "description": "Composition II is an introductory course on writing theory and practice that reinforces and extends the foundational knowledge and practices introduced in Composition I. While students in Composition I focus primarily on writing to make meaning, students in Composition II learn how writing produces knowledge. Students come to understand writing as a knowledge-producing activity through carefully sequenced and scaffolded assignments that encourage them to develop, sustain, and reflect on their own academic inquiry and research processes. Assignments ask students to develop original research questions, locate and evaluate primary and secondary sources, select evidence from multiple complex texts, synthesize evidence-based arguments that use sources to address their inquiry, and reflect on their own learning and development. In conjunction with Composition I, students in Composition II continue to develop the ability to generate and articulate their own claims in dialogue with texts and to develop rhetorical awareness and knowledge of academic discourse conventions. The flexible, adaptable writing knowledge and practices developed across Composition I and Composition II are designed to facilitate students' ability to write self-reflectively in other contexts, which includes intermediate seminars, upperlevel courses, and the Writing Proficiency Requirement.",

In this course, multilingual students build a foundation of university academic writing, language learning, and culture-oriented literacies to successfully integrate in their new community. ENGL 103E offers a balanced developmental approach that highlights the synergies among language proficiency, writing knowledge, and intercultural competency. The course focuses on study topics like meanings of culture, relationships between language and culture, identity, politics, language and power, economic behavior, adaptation to new environments, etc. In working with these topics, students reflect upon challenges arising from ethnocentrism and develop reflective awareness about the value of ethnorelativism. In addition to two major writing projects, students complete periodic reflective journals and/or video blogs through which they further explore course topics and campus resources, engage in the writing process, and practice oral presentation skills.",

We will also examine how young adult literature tackles difficult topics, such as race, class, gender, and sexuality, in stories that mange to be both accessible and deeply thought provoking in their portrayals of diversity. Although this class features young adult literature, it has a heavy reading load and a fast-paced reading schedule."

We will read a selection of texts from a variety of genres as we examine different views on the meaning of food, food consumption, production and sustainability. With the help of the readings and class materials, we will reconsider the ways in which we think about food and the association we have with food, and we will carefully reflect on the implications of our food choices and our responsibilities as consumers in the complex food system. We will have a wiki that I created for our class. Students will be able to extend our class discussions to cyberspace by having a place to further communicate with each other and exchange views and opinions on the issues discussed in class, as well as posting some assignments for review.",

Our goal is to prepare students for the future, but our teaching is rooted in the past. We want students to become independent, but we expect them to follow rigid rules. With all these contradictions it's no surprise that education doesn't 'work' for every student. This class will problematize education by examining our own experiences, looking at literary representations of school and learning, and putting both of them in conversation with what theorists and experts have to say. We will ask whether what we read can lead to a deeper understanding of our own experiences and our culture by examining themes such as gender, race and racism, socioeconomic and poverty, literacy and language and power structures. Working with critical concepts and terminology will enable us to reach a better understanding of how the writing we read works and will help us tell own stories more effectively. In the end you will use your understanding and your experience as a means to developing a potential solution to one of the problems of education."

How do these texts engage with the history, dialects (early, modern, and contemporary), and fluidity of the English language? How do these works register and respond to the rise and decline of the British empire? How does the changing multiracial and multiethnic composition of Britain impact its literature over time?

The answers to these questions for students of literature, rhetoric, and language are found in archives, living treasures of human experience. This course is an exploration of archives generally and Boston archives in particular, as it creates an opportunity for students to read and interpret letters, diaries, journals, books, short stories, publications, and other original literary material in order to discover the specific literary, cultural, geographic, and social moments in which they were created. The course will feature field trips, workshops, and instructional research sessions in order to engage with material like the Hemingway Papers at JFK Library and Archive, meet literary women preserved within the Schlesinger Library at Harvard's digital repository, learn about community archives for LGBTQ Boston, and examine multiple local collections from the University Archives and Special Collections on UMass Boston's campus. This course teaches basic methods for students to begin to construct and reconstruct stories, and to start out further work where the individual's interests in literature, writing, theory, and/or language may take them. The course is aligned with the aims of the Humanities General Education requirement which asks students to develop an informed appreciation of human culture and an exploration of the human condition, and is a hands-on, Interactive course designed with the support of the Mellon Foundation."

This course will examine the ways in which the techniques of literature (e.g., narrative, description, point of view, voice, image) compel readers' attention and bring us nearer to turn to human rights abuses and peoples' capacities to survive and surmount these conditions."

Second, what are the implications of these changes? To address these questions, students study the historical aspects of and theoretical approaches to the study of digital culture, focusing on the connections between reading, writing, writing, and technology. Additionally, coursework requires students to develop their ability to compose digital texts while thinking critically about those texts. Students will consider how textuality is related to changes in media, and what those changes mean for personal, professional, and community life."

            "description": "This course introduces student to the diversity of literary, philosophic, and political topics addressed by postcolonialism. Drawing on a wide range of texts, we will pursue the following avenues of inquiry: What do we mean by the term ''Empire''? How has the reach of Empire been historically constructed, critiqued in fiction, and/or sustained through narrative: What forms of identity are available to individuals who have been displaced, either through personal choice or random (and often tragic) circumstance? And, finally, how ''post'' is postcolonialism? To answer these and related questions, this course will further explore the different experiences of colonization, decolonization, and postcolonial culture and politics during the twentieth century in South Africa, Nigeria, Jamaica, India, Australia, and Northern Ireland. Taking a transdisciplinary approach, we will conduct inquiries into the nature of sociopolitical and cultural conditions that characterize current or former colonies, the diverse registers in which these conditions are discursively articulated, and the modes, spaces, and politics of their (re)production, circulation, and consumption. Some themes this course will address include the psychology of colonization and settlement; violence and decolonization; constructions of the ''Other'' by imperial center; hybrid cultural formations wrought by the impacts between colonizer and colonized. Taking the above statement by Ghosh as instructive, this course will also seek to interrogate the idea that culture is a coherent or self-contained whole; thus, the final portion of this class will address themes of travel, immigration, and concepts of the diaspora, homeland, and exile by attending to the ''new'' cosmopolitanism.",

            "description": "Sustainability, doing what we can now to preserve the environment for the future, is made up of three pillars: environment, economics, and social equity. The environment pillar refers to the goods and services provided by our planet for survival of humans and non-humans. The economics pillar refers to the reality of ensuring livelihoods are protected and enhanced while the environment is being protected for future generations. The social equity pillar refers to ensuring all groups are treated equally and fairness in environmental-decision making for future generations is front and center. Being sustainable, or green, sounds simple, but in practice is not easy. Often, sustainability is pawned off as a quick fix solution, but is this what is best for the long term? Students in this course will learn about, discuss, and act upon the components of sustainability and their role in sustainability by investigating the opportunities and challenges of sustainability in context of their daily lives, their future, and our future generations."

            "description": "This course will examine the basics of working in and managing a successful aquaculture operation. Aquaculture is currently the fastest growing segment of the food industry, with more then half of what we eat from the ocean coming from aquaculture. This is an increasingly competitive space that suffers from a tradition of malpractice and misunderstanding as well as a regulatory culture that lags far behind an innovative rate. Site selection, gear, seed and feed procurement, marketing, and supply chain dynamics are all important elements of a successful aquaculture operation that demand an understanding of regulatory, financial, and marketing and entrepreneurial principles. This course is designed to introduce students to these challenges and equip them with the tools needed to engage within the industry on a sophisticated, successful level. Students will gain a foundational understanding of how to move from ''I would like to operate an aquaculture business'' to ''I am operating an aquaculture business''. Building on this understanding, students will prepare their own business plans to demonstrate mastery of key aspects of operational efficiency necessary support the vital financial structure of any business. Lastly, through the concepts of entrepreneurship, students will learn how to integrate business concepts to be able to develop and sustain a successful aquaculture business. This course will be organized into three parts: Essentials for a business in aquaculture, operating a business in aquaculture, and moving from concept to execution. This course alludes to but does not deeply discuss the complex and ever changing regulatory, policy, and legal systems that govern operations in this sector."

            "description": "With the Atlantic Ocean on UMass-Boston's doorstep, this place-based course immerses students in the history, culture, and science of Boston Harbor and its Islands to understand the natural and anthropogenic factors shaping our waterfront. The impacts of anthropogenic development and climate change extend from the bustling city of Boston to the outer reaches of Boston Harbor Islands and the consequences of these impacts are shared across UMass-Boston's neighboring communities (e.g. Quincy, Dorchester, and East Boston) and abiotic and biotic communities. Thus, this course will investigate the evolving relationships between people, plants, and animals across this aquatic landscape from a transdisciplinary basis, the integration of knowledge systems to move beyond discipline specific problem-solving approaches. Students will learn how to conduct archival research and scientific experiments, participate in service-learning opportunities, and engage in roundtable discussions with local indigenous communities, environmental organizations, and researchers. The culmination of these activities will introduce students to methods they can employ for their final project: a proposal on a research topic they would like to lead at the Living Laboratory on Rainsford Island, Boston Harbor Islands. Throughout the course, students will reflect on their own relationships with water and their surroundings and the role they want to play as stewards of Boston Harbor, its Islands, and UMass-Boston. This course was developed through the ''Living with the Urban Ocean'' grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities."

We foreground how racial, ethnic, socioeconomic class, and gender groups experience ecological disasters intensified by climate change. In addition to examining the disproportionate impact on low-income, communities of color, and Indigenous peoples, we will examine how these communities are leading resistance to ecological disasters and environmental violence. We will examine the power dynamics of environmental issues via media and film, journalism, public relations, advertising, rhetoric, and public participation and activism to understand how communication can create a more just and sustainable world. Students will interpret and analyze the voices of individuals and groups struggling to define major environmental topics, such as: climate change and pollution, energy, water, food and agriculture, biodiversity and extinction, ocean life, wilderness habitat, war, and consumerism.",

Students in this course learn the scientific basis of energy balance, energy metabolism, and the regulation of body weights in humans. Students also receive and introduction to the fundamentals of the biology of appetite regulation and genetics of obesity. The critical independent and inter-related roles physical activity, healthy nutrition, and health behavior change have to prevent and reduce obesity in children and adults are emphasized throughout the course. Students also study psychosocial factors related to obesity and emerging strategies for obesity treatment such as pharmacological and surgical approaches. An important aspect of this course is  the opportunity  for students to obtain experience  reviewing current literature  on a selected topic related to obesity and weight management.",

This course takes a transhistorical view of Western civilization, from the Middle Ages to the present, in order to trace and interrogate societal constructs about love. Our goal is to figure out how love stories work, so that we understand better how they work on us. As part of this work, we will explore how people have historically disrupted heteronormative and patriarchal narratives of love, forming alternative models of domestic bliss. We will consider society and history through literature, so texts like sonnets, love letters, and excerpts from novels will make up the bulk of our reading. However, assignments will be drawn from multiple disciplines, as well as popular culture, including song lyrics, reality television, and film.FRENCH 374L and ITAL 374L and GERMAN 374L and MLLC 374L are the same course.",

From the Beatles' ''all you need is love'' to Shakespeare's ''whoever loved that loved not at first sight?'' we are bombarded in our culture with preconceived notions about the nature of amorous affection. This course takes a transhistorical view of Western civilization, from the Middle Ages to the present, in order to trace and interrogate societal constructs about love. Our goal is to figure out how love stories work, so that we understand better how they work on us. As part of this work, we will explore how people have historically disrupted heteronormative and patriarchal narratives of love, forming alternative models of domestic bliss. We will consider society and history through literature, so texts like sonnets, love letters, and excerpts from novels will make up the bulk of our reading. However, assignments will be drawn from multiple disciplines, as well as popular culture, including song lyrics, reality television, and film.FRENCH 374L and ITAL 374L and GERMAN 374L and MLLC 374L are the same course.",

            "description": "This course may be taken either as a capstone project or as a capstone internship. This course should be taken in the final semester of study and should only be taken after the completion of all major courses. Capstone project: The capstone project allows students to demonstrate the ability to use the knowledge, concepts, and methods acquired in the Global Affairs major in an innovative project that may involve research in literature or language, a portfolio of creative work, or an alternative that is approved by the program director. Internship: Students who decide to pursue a capstone internship will get the opportunity to apply their learning in a real-world environment. The experience will consist of an internship that will last at least 3 months. Internships have proven to be invaluable to students' career opportunities and effectiveness in the workplace. Students will be required to draw from their previous coursework to enhance their internship experience. The internship option includes a final paper that illustrates how learning from Global Affairs coursework has been effectively applied to real world practice."

            "description": "People have been trying to understand the fall of Rome since the fall of Rome. In 200 CE, the Roman Empire was the largest, most diverse, and most powerful state the Mediterranean world had ever seen. By 500, the Western half of the Empire had splintered into smaller kingdoms that would eventually become the basis for modern European states. What happened? This course will examine the political, military, environmental, and social changes of the Empire as it loses territory and transforms into the medieval world. But we will spend just as much time trying to understand what it was like for typical Romans to live through this period. We will study armies and taxes, but also the rise of Christianity, the prevalence of slavery, the shifting gender norms, and the stories that filled the imaginations of people throughout this time. We will discuss major ancient cities like Rome and Constantinople, but we'll also venture out to the edges of the Empire and beyond learning about the Goths, Celts, Sassanians, and more.In addition to learning about the transformation of the Roman Empire between 250 and 800, students will also practice thinking like historians; that is, we will think about possibilities and limitations of the wide range of sources that historians use to piece together what happened and why it matters. How do we know what we know about the past? And why should we care how history is written?  ",

The first half of the course will focus on the films of the Weimar Republic - a time of bold artistic experimentation when Germany's film industry was second only to Hollywood in worldwide influence. The second half of the semester will be devoted to the cinema produced in Germany during the Nazi dictatorship, when movies were no longer simply entertainment, but also served as an important form of propaganda. The films of both of these periods will be analyzed as historical sources that illuminate the society that produced them.",

Self-assessment is a crucial aspect of the Honors College IS, as it is of the university-wide IS, and instructors are encouraged to develop self-assessment tools so that students may evaluate their growth as writers and also learn to recognize their strengths and areas for improvement. The Honors College Intermediate Seminar also requires students to use technology, for example, to access electronic databases for secondary material or construct a powerpoint slideshow for an in-class presentation. The Honors Intermediate Seminar exhibits a central feature of the Honors curriculum: interdisciplinary for content and pedagogy. Thus, and Honors intermediate seminar includes materials from different disciplines (the intermediate seminar on ''collecting'' for example, draws on readings from psychology, sociology, and history; the intermediate seminar on ''Baseball'' includes perspectives and analyses of the game from biology, physics, and history). Students are taught how to engage texts and data/information from multiple disciplines, and through the IS pedagogy, they are equipped with the skills to synthesize their understanding of concepts across disparate disciplines. Instruction might also include field trips to significant sites so that students can acquire hands-on experience with relevant materials and interact with practitioners in their work locations.

All human behavior, whether it is physical, social, or cognitive, comes into being through the processes of development. Developmental changes result from the interaction of various influences. These influences can range from the heredity prenatal environment to the broadest social and cultural factors. Basic concepts and theories are used to explain these life-long developmental changes. Familiarity and concepts and theories of development are essential tools of an effective human services worker. This course will examine life-span development and the role of the human service worker in helping individuals and families respond to the challenges in productive ways. Students will conduct field observations of a life stage and apply theory to explaining their behavior."

Case management functions include client screening, risk assessment; service planning, implementation, monitoring and reassessment of the service plan. Case managers seek to support client self-determination but are also charged with controlling costs and rationing services posing ethical dilemmas for workers. We will examine best practice guidelines for case management and apply theory to practice in the field. We will examine case management from the perspective of the consumer, practitioner, other providers and the service system. A major focus of this class is critical examination of case management practice in a variety of settings. This highly interactive class will involve a combination of lecture, class discussion of anonymous case vignettes drawn from the field, and field interviewing."

Each participant has a role in understanding topics that are prevalent in the scientific community along with developing new information that might form the basic science investments of the future. This is a two-semester sequence, two credits each semester. Successful completion of the sequence will fulfill student's First-Year Seminar requirement. Course content will vary with instructor, but will focus on discussion of topics with broad societal impact, and will have important scientific underpinnings, with a particular focus on science topics. Using this approach, students will become increasingly familiar with and experienced in scientific discourse, the scientific method, and important new scientific findings. Desired outcomes will focus on student developing discovery skills, becoming self-driven learners, learning to work in groups and being successful at the university. This course will maximize students' potential for success in the university and the scientific community. There will be two major writing assignments with feedback on all submitted work. Grading will be based on class participation (Wiki's, class interactions), written papers, and an inquiry-based examination."

It introduces students to the historical development of crime literature focusing on key authors, genres and movements. Beginning with the popularization of crime narratives in the era of Enlightenment, the course examines the development of genre conventions in subsequent centuries until the post-modern disintegration of narrative patterns. Particular emphasis is placed on the construction of gender roles, social class, national and regional identity through literature as a cultural practice. Taught in English; readings in the original language are available upon request. "

From the Beatles' ''all you need is love'' to Shakespeare's ''whoever loved that loved not at first sight?'' we are bombarded in our culture with preconceived notions about the nature of amorous affection. This course takes a transhistorical view of Western civilization, from the Middle Ages to the present, in order to trace and interrogate societal constructs about love. Our goal is to figure out how love stories work, so that we understand better how they work on us. As part of this work, we will explore how people have historically disrupted heteronormative and patriarchal narratives of love, forming alternative models of domestic bliss. We will consider society and history through literature, so texts like sonnets, love letters, and excerpts from novels will make up the bulk of our reading. However, assignments will be drawn from multiple disciplines, as well as popular culture, including song lyrics, reality television, and film.FRENCH 374L and ITAL 374L and GERMAN 374L and MLLC 374L are the same course.",

While work and organized labor receive central attention, the course gives equal consideration to the comparative dimensions of class and cultural identity, race and gender, immigration and ethnicity, family and community, technology, politics, and government policy. We will work to improve our skills in critical reading and writing. Lectures, readings, videos, and discussion explore the actions, opinions, identities, and experiences of diverse women and men. You will work on understanding and interpreting the materials. Short essays, in-class exams, and presentation will provide opportunities to develop your interpretations systematically and polish your writing skills."

We explore migration both within and between countries, considering the different reasons that women and men of diverse cultures, nations, races, and ethnicities leave one place and settle in another. It looks at migration historically, studying the reasons for fluctuations in the scale of migration (especially immigration to the United States) over time, and reasons for changes in the United States' degree of ''openness'' to immigrants. The course considers the conditions of work and life for immigrants themselves - including differences in conditions for different immigrant groups- as well as effects on people in the countries from which immigrants come. It looks at immigration restrictions not only in terms of their effects on the number of people entering the United States, but also in terms of their effects on the status and rights of people who live and work here. The course also looks seriously at the relationship between the conditions under which immigration takes place, on the one hand, and wages and conditions of work, on the other. It pays particular attention to the effects of immigration law and enforcement on immigrant workers' bargaining power at work.",

Organizers develop the relationships, motivate participation, facilitate strategy and enable people to gain new appreciation of their values, the resources, and interests and a new capacity to use their resources on behalf of their interests. In this course, students will use case study methods to explore the various applications of organizing, methods of organizing and strategic approaches to organizing campaigns. The primary focus will be labor and labor/community organizing, but the course will be useful to any student who wishes to pursue organizing approaches to social justice."

We will discuss Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its applications to data analysis. We will study linear transformations and change of basis. We will discuss complex vector spaces and Jordan canonical form of Matrices. We will discuss non-negative matrices and Perron-Frobenius Theory. We will explain multiple matrix factorisations, such as LU, QR, NMF. Finally we will discuss other applications such as the Fast Discrete Fourier Transform. For each of these topics we will discuss numerical computer algorithms and their implementations. In particular we will discuss in detail eigenvalue estimation, including iterative and direct methods, such as Hausholder methods, tri-diagonalzation, power methods, and power method with shifts. We will explain concepts of numerical analysis that are important to consider when we talk about the implementation of algorithms, such as stability and convergence. We will discuss iterative methods as well as direct ones, their advantages and disadvantages. The methods are their applications will be illustrated using a common programming language such as python and/or R.",

This automation is accomplished by writing small programs which are specific to the task at hand. These programs are best written in programming languages which are simple and flexible. This makes languages designed for large projects, such as Java and C++, unsuitable for this task.To meet this need, scripting languages such as Perl, Python, and PHP have been created. These languages are designed to be easier to learn than more demanding programming languages such as Java, C and C++.This course will teach the basics of scripting language and show students how it can be used to automate routine system administration and workflow tasks.",

From the Beatles' ''all you need is love'' to Shakespeare's ''whoever loved that loved not at first sight?'' we are bombarded in our culture with preconceived notions about the nature of amorous affection. This course takes a transhistorical view of Western civilization, from the Middle Ages to the present, in order to trace and interrogate societal constructs about love. Our goal is to figure out how love stories work, so that we understand better how they work on us. As part of this work, we will explore how people have historically disrupted heteronormative and patriarchal narratives of love, forming alternative models of domestic bliss. We will consider society and history through literature, so texts like sonnets, love letters, and excerpts from novels will make up the bulk of our reading. However, assignments will be drawn from multiple disciplines, as well as popular culture, including song lyrics, reality television, and film.FRENCH 374L and ITAL 374L and GERMAN 374L and MLLC 374L are the same course.",

From there, we will delve into a critical examination of the connections between musical listening, learning, and the socially situated act of musical involvement. These initial explorations will serve as an entry point to thinking about music teacher identity and student's past, present, and future experiences as a student, teacher, musician, and human. The latter portion of the class will be devoted to exploring critical issues in the field ranging from power, privilege, class, and marginalized populations, to thinking about ''whose music?'' cultural capital and relevancy."

The lecture portion of the course emphasizes the impact of health problems and the interaction of the environment and access on diverse urban adult populations. Students refine and expand their knowledge through the application of the nursing process and the integration of knowledge, concepts and theories from nursing, sciences, and general education courses. The focus is on nursing interventions for selected adult patients whose quality of life is affected by deviations from health. The clinical practicum occurs within acute care settings and provides the student with experience in content application, collaboration and critical thinking. In addition, students enhance their communication and teaching/learning skills by assuming a leadership role in the seminar portion of the course.",

The following are the sorts of questions with which they were preoccupied, and upon which we focus in reading them: Is there a single ideal life which all human beings should strive to live-and if so, what does it consist in? What are the virtues that human beings should exemplify? Why should one live a moral life? Are there objective moral standards-and if so, how does one discover what they are? What roles do reason and the emotions, respectively, play in the moral life? Special attention is given to the role that one's metaphysical views and one's views of human nature play in shaping one's theory of ethics."

The longer writing project aims to equip students with skills and habits essential to higher-level scholarly work: formulating and clarifying a philosophical question from scratch, composing and revising cogent philosophical prose, interpreting and analyzing complex texts, engaging with opposing arguments, using appropriate practices of style and documentation, giving and receiving constructive feedback. It requires a level of independence beyond what is expected in typical undergraduate assignments, crucial for developing as a philosopher and an independent thinker.",

The second part of the course focuses on political institutions. Students will learn the different forms of democracies and autocracies by examining the institutions and political processes. The course seeks to understand the mechanisms through which the political institutions and processes affect citizens, behaviors and political outcomes while comparing developing and developed countries. The third part of the course discusses political issues and policy outcomes including challenges to democracies, women and politics, social cleavages, and inequality and redistribution. Throughout the course, students will develop informed and coherent arguments on relevant topics through discussions, debates, simulation games, and research."

In this course we explore both, the foundational texts of Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault, as well as the reception, further development, and complication of their theories in the works of other contemporary political theorists, such as Giorgio Agamben, Roberto Esposito, and Achille Mbembe."

This course emphasizes consideration of equity and disparities in health, building your understanding of how and why health disparities occur across the U.S. population, how to think about ethics related to both action and inaction in the face of health inequities, and what can be done to achieve health equity. We will explore questions such as, Why do Americans, on average, experience worse health and shorter lifespans than people in other developed countries? Why do some groups of Americans experience worse health and shorter lifespans than other groups? Is health and health care a ''right''? and does every American actually have the same ability to pursue health and wellness as their fellow citizens do? What can we as a society do to reduce health disparities and promote health for every person in our country? What can we as individuals do to make sure we experience the best physical and mental health we can?",

The course explores a continuum of mental health, as well as contextual influences on psychological functioning and dysfunction. This course covers some of the material that was historically covered in our ''Abnormal Psychology'' course, and includes a critical analysis of the APA's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). While diagnoses are covered in the course, the course does not teach students how to diagnose others - to do so requires graduate level work.",

Therapeutic Mentoring is designed to give children and teens the opportunity for skill building through experiences that would naturally occur in their everyday life, at their home, foster home, childcare center, or other setting. To help the child develop a specified skill, their Therapeutic Mentor works to model, educate, motivate, and coach them on how to use and practice overcoming obstacles related to these skills.  Services are provided in any setting where the youth resides, such as the home (including foster homes and therapeutic foster homes), and in community settings, such as schools, child care centers, respite settings, as well as other culturally and linguistically appropriate community settings."

In this course we will engage with the neighborhoods, culture, and people of the Boston area through primary data collection such as conducting interviews or participant observation. Using our sociological imaginations, we will draw on sociological theories and concepts to analyze data we have gathered and locate our data in the larger context of local, national, and global social structures. We will learn to use the library to locate scholarly resources as well as participate in activities that seek to improve writing skills in order to successfully complete the written portion of our research projects. These writing activities will include developing a research question or puzzle, constructing a thesis statement or argument, using scholarly research to support your arguments, explaining your methods for data collection, and effectively deploying theory or concepts to answer 'why' questions about your data. Through this engagement with the Boston area, we explore the careers students may pursue with a BA or higher degree in sociology. To this end, we will learn effective paths for completing a BA in sociology and learn about research that sociologists at UMass Boston are currently engaged in. Therefore, this course is designed for and open to declared sociology majors. Non sociology majors must receive instructor approval to join this course. Finally, we will work towards career planning by tackling practical concerns such as cover letter and resume writing.",

            "description": "Religion, like film, makes worlds. Practitioners, like viewers, are asked to suspend belief in order to enter another world-and then find that world in this world. We leave a detective movie and start seeing the world as a series of clues; we leave a prayer meeting and start looking for moments of grace in daily life. This course serves as both an introduction to the methods and key terms in the study of religion and as a way to gain a richer understanding of why we watch films and how they work on us. We address topics such as: How do films such as Christopher Nolan's ''The Dark Knight'' or Julie Dash's ''Daughters of the Dust'' organize the world through myths about good and evil and with rituals that bind communities across generations? How does the Coen brother's ''A Serious Man'' retell a Biblical story for the present? And how do Afro-futurist films such as Sun Ra's ''Space is the Place'' help viewers imagine world not structured by racism?"

            "description": "People have been trying to understand the fall of Rome since the fall of Rome. In 200 CE, the Roman Empire was the largest, most diverse, and most powerful state the Mediterranean world had ever seen. By 500, the Western half of the Empire had splintered into smaller kingdoms that would eventually become the basis for modern European states. What happened? This course will examine the political, military, environmental, and social changes of the Empire as it loses territory and transforms into the medieval world. But we will spend just as much time trying to understand what it was like for typical Romans to live through this period. We will study armies and taxes, but also the rise of Christianity, the prevalence of slavery, the shifting gender norms, and the stories that filled the imaginations of people throughout this time. We will discuss major ancient cities like Rome and Constantinople, but we'll also venture out to the edges of the Empire and beyond learning about the Goths, Celts, Sassanians, and more.In addition to learning about the transformation of the Roman Empire between 250 and 800, students will also practice thinking like historians; that is, we will think about possibilities and limitations of the wide range of sources that historians use to piece together what happened and why it matters. How do we know what we know about the past? And why should we care how history is written?  ",

This course explores a range of contemplative practices, mainly from Hindu, Buddhist, and/or Daoist traditions. We will also explore modern, secularized offshoots of these practices, such as mindfulness and postural yoga, which are now used widely in clinical settings and are the subject of much scientific research. The course will draw on perspectives such as the comparative study of religion, philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. Moreover, we will approach meditation both academically and experimentally: participants will study contemplative practices in their historical, cultural, and religious contexts, wand will likewise engage in the practice of mediation, in both traditional and modern varieties. Going beyond seated mediation, we will explore contemplative practices and the traditional creative arts (e.g. poetry and calligraphy); musical meditations; and contemplative body-mind practices (e.g. poetry and calligraphy); musical meditations; and contemplative body-mind practices (e.g. walking meditation, yoga, and/or Qi Gong). The course hence integrates conventional academic study with a unique form of experiential learning. Meditation practice is an essential component of the course.

In addition to reading plays, we will consider such issues as the physical form of the stage, various approaches to acting, the changing constitution of audiences, and costume history, all with a mind to exploring the socio-historical forces that influenced the development of the theatre."

Issues concerning the environment, housing, education, health, jobs, land use, revenue generation, organizational structures, transportation, and many others require understanding the logic and results of quantitative analyses. Planners, analysts, and researchers collect and use information to examine societal problems. Individuals concerned with planning and policy decisions rely on statistics to formulate agendas and make decisions. Organized quantitative information is central to understanding a community and to measuring the impact of community health and development strategies. Whether you choose to work in government, nonprofit organizations, business, or as a policy analyst, you will benefit from a good understanding of statistical analyses. This course builds upon knowledge of descriptive and inferential statistics and probability theory, and the application of statistics in social scientific research. This course has two main foci. The statistical focus includes understanding descriptive and inferential statistical concepts and the interpretation of statistical results. The second is applied quantitative data management and analysis in SPSS, a tool for the statistical analysis of data. It allows researchers to perform a wide variety of statistical procedures. A primary goal of the course is to provide students with a basic knowledge of the program in order to be able to use it in social research.",

Using a combination of historical, sociological, financial, and political economy perspectives, students will examine the role and interdependence of institutional actors in housing development. These institutional actors include different levels of governments, private for-profit corporations, and nonprofit organizations. Students will learn the approaches undertaken by different configuration of these institutional actors to address housing issues in a variety of political, economic, and social contexts. Finally, students will examine various housing issues (affordability, discrimination, gentrification, homelessness) and attempts to address these issues, paying particular attention to the ways that these issues differentially impact groups across lines of race, ethnicity, and socio-economic status."

Rather than studying sexuality as something that human beings are born with, for example, the course focuses on the ways that issues of desire, pleasure, identity, norms of sexual behavior, and intimate arrangements are deeply shaped by a range of historically specific social forces. Focusing on the U.S., a ''social constructionist'' framework guides the course. Family, religion, and social media will be studied as important social sites where struggles around sexualities and their meanings are played out."

Specifically, this course examines the ways that individuals and society create, reinforce, and challenge the meaning of gender. This course will discuss and examine how we develop gender identities (and how these identities differ from biological sex), how this identity is shaped through the messages we receive from a number of communication systems (family, education, media, etc.), and how our gender identities in turn influence our communication patterns. As we go through the course, we'll examine various masculine and feminine roles and stereotypes, and the impact of gender stereotypes on communication. We will also consider the limitations of gender binaries, and explore a diverse array of gender identification and expression."

By reading the stories of individuals and groups in these contexts, the course explores how socio-cultural notions of gender and sexuality, often deeply embedded among communities; perpetuate inequalities among South Asian subjects. It utilized life history, the novel, film, political critique and other literary genres to examine cultural and material foundations of inequality in contemporary South Asia, especially among women of particular religions, class, caste, and ethnicities.",

It illustrates the diversity of kinship definitions with ethnographic examples from the Iban of Indonesian Borneo, the Nyakyusa of East Africa, and other societies from the Americas, Africa, Asia, and the pacific Islands. Through an exploration of the pressures to which African American families have been subjected in the United States, it probes the ways in which the legacy of slavery shapes the possibilities and perceptions of contemporary families."

        "course_descriptors": {
            "description": "Globalization is drawing increasing numbers of women (and men) into cross-border transactions in which the reproductive and sexual body is the desired object of exchange. These global markets raise important questions about what it means for human dignity when body parts and services are treated as commercially available. Do these transactions commodify women (particularly those from the Global South) by treating them as disposable, fragmentary bodies for the benefit of wealthy customers? Or do they offer new pathways out of poverty, by enabling women to assert control over this productive resource? Using a transnational feminist and human rights lens, this course examines these issues, with a particular focus on sex tourism/trafficking and gestational surrogacy. The course also looks at a very different type of cross-border travel - namely, the flight of persons in conflict zones for the purpose of escaping political violence rather than to seek or sell an intimate service. Specifically, we consider the unique challenges that refugees and internally displaced persons confront when seeking to access reproductive health services, including abortion."

Through a multi-disciplinary approach, the course addresses issues and challenges of contemporary Africa, and explores many of the themes and concerns that have run throughout Africa's gendered, complex, and changing history. Popular culture sources, as well as scholarly studies and activist writing, will be employed to help illuminate the lived experiences and perspectives of contemporary women living in various African societies."

Activists, artists, and theorists have mobilized queer of color critique to interrogate the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, class, nation, and diaspora as a response to the inherent whiteness of mainstream queer theory and persistent heterosexism in ethnic studies. Students will gain an understanding of queer of color critique as a humanistic method of inquiry that includes the analysis and interpretation of ideas and symbolic expression. We will examine the development of queer of color critique (primarily in the United States) through both academic and activist domains; consider what queer theory has to say about empire, citizenship, prisons, welfare, neoliberalism, and terrorism; and articulate the role of queer of color analysis in a vision for racial, gender, sexual, and economic justice.",

Since its emergence in the 1960's, historical archaeology has grown to become the most rapidly expanding field of archaeological research. Starting with a focus on North America, historical archaeology is now a global field that concentrates on the study of the emergence of the modern world and other complex societies. Drawing on a rich palette of interdisciplinary approaches, historical archaeology explores complex global processes such as colonization, industrialization, urbanization, and globalization. This course will focus on the methods employed by the field's practitioners, the various contexts in which this work is conducted, and the theoretical underpinnings of the field as a whole.",

Students will explore a variety of dialogues around the topic of Latinidad as a historical category built on the bases of narratives of resistance, survival, and recognition. Since the 1960s, Latin American archaeologists have developed their own interpretations of the past, ones that differ from North American archaeology. Latin American historical archaeology specifically has generated post-colonial theories and practices developed in the peripheries and for local communities, aiming for social justice and active processes of decolonization. The course also explores diverse practices and discourses around Latin American material heritage as an adaptable source for ethnic, national, and gender narratives in the present so that students can learn about the past with a deep influence in present social, political, and cultural dynamics around Latin@ collective identities in the Americas."

Students will learn basic techniques for acquiring, manipulating and creating geospatial data in several forms, from raster-based satellite imagery and digital terrain models to point, line and polygon representation of vector data. Students will create a GIS project for a region of their choice; this may be an area of personal interest or for thesis research."

This course will draw upon the seminal work of a diverse group of theorists, including writings from the Frankfurt School (Marcuse, Adomo, Horkheimer), Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser, and others. Within a historical context, the course will focus on early theories of social and cultural reproduction, theories of resistance, and the hidden curriculum. The latter part of the course will situate some of the early reform issues about schooling within a more recent context in order to illuminate how such issues resonate with current public discourses on schooling and radical pedagogy. We will examine the work of Critical Pedagogues such as Paulo Freire, Henry Giroux, bell hooks, Stanley Aronowitz, Michael Apple, etc. Finally, we will look into the application of Critical Pedagogy framework to classroom practice for language teachers. Major themes of the course include: education as cultural force, hegemony and the politics of hidden curriculum, popular cultures, public pedagogy and cultural politics, capitalism, neo-liberalism and education, and the role of educators as public intellectuals."

We will cover both traditional and alternative theories in SLA (including sociocultural theory, socio-cognitive theory, conversation analysis, identify theory, socialization theory, complexity/dynamic systems theory, and cognitive linguistics). In addition, the course addresses theory building and two critical questions: (1) can/should the field tolerate multiple theories? (2) if it cannot/should not, how do we decide which theory to support and which theories to disallow? Students will practice evaluation the goals, strengths, and limitations of various perspectives as well as look at the implications for L2 learning, teaching, and research in light of the reading on SLA theories."

Profit-seeking corporations transform economic resources into outputs via organizations; governmental agencies delivered services and regulate other organizations; and numerous non-governmental organizations, from unions to churches to advocacy groups, constitute the realm of civil society. Organizations shape how a society functions. They are the vehicles through which societal-level interests and agendas are channeled. They represent a form a structural power; some groups systematically benefit relative to others as a result of how organizations operate. Organizations are frequently the target of public policy, as they are sites of both societal aspirations (productivity, innovation, opportunities for advancement) and societal challenges (inequality, discrimination, pollution, deception). Organizations can also be arenas of resistance and change, advancing new ideas and addressing old problems. An understanding of organizations - their sources of power, their role in governance, and their structures and processes - is therefore highly relevant for future researchers who wish to conduct studies of use for policy analysts, activists, and managers in the private, public, and non-profit sectors."

The core assumption of this class is that research is a craft with rules, norms, and best practices that are not always obvious. The primary goal is to demystify research practice and give students the tools to better connect research methods to contemporary theoretical debates within management and organizational theory, both of which are key to the development of original research projects."

            "description": "This course examines psychopharmacology for counselors and is taught from a social justice perspective. It will provide students with an overview of the medications used for treating mental disorders. The basic principles of pharmacology and the interrelationships between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will also be addressed. The emphasis is on practical and clinical application. Special topics will include: the nature of alcohol and narcotics and the ways they affect addicts in mind and body before, during, and after treatment as well as psychopharmacological treatment for addictions; informed consent; how to find accurate and balanced information about the efficacy and side effects of psychotropic medications; how to educate my clients about the medications they are taking; how to collaborate with prescribing providers and other mental health professionals. Students will also become conversant with regulatory standards for the approval of new medications. Social justice and bioethical issues will figure predominately in this course with reference to for-profit IRB's, recruitment of marginalized groups such as undocumented immigrants, the homeless, and people living in poverty, and discrepancies in prescription practices.",

How does a writing exercise elicit a response that adds to students' understanding of what they're doing? What's a good sequence of exercises, and what should students read to enhance their understanding of technique? How should students share their work - in a workshop, in small groups, on an on-line bulletin board, and other formats? How should creative writing be evaluated? Each week, we will examine a different pedagogical question. The course also addresses workshop and classroom management. Students will leave the course with the practical and theoretical tools necessary to construct a curriculum for their own classroom use, and an understanding of issues involved in exploring creativity."

The thesis is written under the supervision of a thesis advisor, read by a thesis committee of a least three members, and subject to a public thesis defense. The MFA thesis is the focus of each student's three years of graduate study. It represents the best work the student has produced - informed by the MFA workshops, by the study of literature, and by subjects relevant to the student's project - mentored by faculty, directed by an advisor, and nurtured by an engaged community of writers."

New technologies, climate change, economic crises as well as contemporary iterations of terrorism and warfare have all intensified the global movements of people, goods, ideas, cultures, and money. This has reinvigorated the study of migration in earlier periods, with many arguing that related phenomena have been endemic to the human population since our beginning. New frameworks that emphasize networks and relationality, and bring into the foreground interculturalism, borders and borderlands, and hybridic formations have begun to reorder ways of reading human cultures and civilizations. The course brings together theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches from both the humanities and social sciences (e.g. anthropology, literary studies, performance studies, psychology, ethnomusicology, sociolinguistics, history, and sociology) with various forms of cultural expression (e.g., poetry, film, music, literature). The course places the different theories/strategies in dialogue to empower students of transdisciplinarity with tools for shaping their own unique studies of migration and diaspora in ways that exceed the boundaries of particular disciplines. Themes explored will include: the contexts for the newly invigorated field; the multiple meanings and models of diaspora and migration; the relation of migration and diaspora to conquest, colonialism, post colonialism, refugeeism, political exile, etc.; the heterogeneity of diasporic groups; the problems and potentials of assimilation, acculturation and transculturation; nativism and the hostility of hostlands; generational conflicts and continuities in the (re)production of culture; the role of language and other cultural practices in migratory experiences; the significance of memory for the production of what Salman Rushdie calls ''imaginary homelands''; and t"

The project will include an analysis of relevant, critical literature along with the development of an appropriate, meaningful intervention to address the issue. This intervention may involve, for example, an organizing initiative, the planning of a program, the design of a training curriculum or the proposal for a research project. Students participate in a weekly Capstone Seminar led by a faculty member, and will also be mentored by a capstone advisor. Those students seeking to go on to a PhD program will be advised to pursue a research-based capstone project. In addition, the Capstone Seminar provides participants with an opportunity to review and reflect on their work in the TCCS Master's program and its impact on their current and future professional and personal lives. In sharing their process and products with each other throughout the semester, students will be able to demonstrate knowledge and integration of skills, process, and strategies of transdisciplinary thinking and grounded, local/global, reflective practice. Capstone projects will be presented by and for seminar participants, together with public audiences, as appropriate, during the final third of the semester."

Students spend one day a week in a PreK-2nd grade public school classroom where they start observing and incrementally taking responsibilities. From helping one single student to small group monitoring, the experience leads to the teaching of a lesson to the whole class that is assessed by the university supervisor. Such assessment is discussed with each individual student and a plan to identify areas and strategies for improvement is completed."

It is designed as a foundation for understanding the policies, goals, assumptions, strategies, and practices of multicultural approaches to education. It draws on a variety of models to construct educational curricula that are multicultural and socially reconstructionist. Readings are placed within the context of public schooling today in order to develop students' ''cultural consciousness'' and awareness of the individual and shared societal assumptions we bring to our teaching experiences.

Using principles of Universal Design of Learning (UDL), Multicultural Education, and Linguistically Relevant Pedagogy, we will identify and apply appropriate strategies to design and modify curriculum, instructional materials, and assessment for students with moderate disabilities in general education classroom environments. Grounded in Narrative Inquiry, participants will examine various perceptions of disability and diversity; study the historical and legal foundations of inclusion; interrogate the misrepresentation of culturally and linguistically diverse students in special education; design inclusive, academically rigorous, culturally and linguistically responsive environments for all students; and develop and reflect on their philosophy of inclusion. Students will anchor their analysis of these issues on a pedagogy of equity, diversity, and transformation by applying the framework of intersectionality. Through Backwards Design Planning, Team-Based Learning, the Jig-Saw classroom, reflective teaching, and digital storytelling we will investigate the intersections among various social categories -- among them ability, language, culture, race, and socioeconomic status -- and explore how we can promote inclusive and equitable educational practices for all learners."

In the process, students will develop criteria for evaluating pedagogical uses of video games; examine the legal, ethical, and moral issues surrounding pedagogical uses of technologies; and make the argument for the pedagogical soundness of their own curricular game. Students will use rigorous playtesting to revise their curricular game and write a teaching implementation plan which will include how their curricular game teaches, assesses, and adjusts to student needs. Lastly, students will help a k-12 teacher outside of class develop his or her own curricular game."

Topics include: oral language development for emergent literacy; lesson planning with clear assessment goals for enduring understandings; foundational reading skills for meaningful text comprehension; organization of classroom literacy instruction; management of responsive, differentiated literacy classrooms; and strengthening home/school connections. A consistent focus is the teachers as a knowledgeable and skilled decision maker."

To do so, this course aims to deepen students' understandings of the reading and writing processes with written, hyper, and multi-modal texts as well as content-specific strategies for assisting K-12 students' development in these processes. This include selecting developmentally appropriate reading materials and composition activities for a range of learners; identifying prerequisite skills, concepts, and vocabulary necessary for content-specific learning activities; and determining which strategies best meet particular content learning objectives. In doing so, techniques for incorporating new technologies into teaching as well as the legal and ethical challenges for both teachers and students will be examined."

The purpose of this course is to prepare the Commonwealth's teachers with the knowledge and skills to effectively shelter their content instruction so that our growing population of English language learners (ELLs) can access curriculum, achieve academic success, and contribute their multilingual and multicultural resources as participants and future leaders in the 21st century global economy. This course debunks notions of linguistic deficit and explore avenues to support multilingual students in the construction of knowledge and skills in the content areas. Participants will engage in the reflective and interactive design of instruction that integrates the WIDA (ELD) standards with Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks, exploring and implementing strategies to teach multilingual learners to read and write in the content areas."

Practitioners who are interested in leadership roles in schools and other urban educational settings function in a variety of roles in many large and small organizations: teachers and classroom administrators in buildings or programs, members of a department or team, students in a graduate classroom, union members and leaders, parents of school-aged children and part of a school community. Practitioners also play roles in organizations outside of schools-in community groups, sports teams, religious groups, etc. The course helps look at those organizations and the roles played within them, by offering a broad set of perspectives drawn from the extensive literature on organizations. Learning to understand and use multiple perspectives for analyzing organizations allows us to reflect on our roles in them, even as it expands the set of possible choices for taking action and leadership within them."

For example, what happened when printing press technology made books inexpensive and readily available to a buying public? The course will also analyze the way ''history of the book'' studies are being transformed due to the digital reproduction of archival materials. What does it mean to interact with a rare book online? In addition, as the course examines rare books and manuscripts, students will uncover the role of the literary scholar and his/her ability to shape the form given to the literary work. What happens to a rare book when it is edited for publication?"

Imaginative literature has long been a forum for women to intervene in political discourse, well before they had the vote, and in some cases, before they were liberated from slavery. This course provides both a survey of women's literature as well an introduction to key developments in feminist theory. From sentimental fiction to graphic novels, we will consider how women writers contend with the pressures of heteronormativity, the problems and pleasures of embodiment, and the anxieties of authorship itself. We will examine how female experience cannot be disentangled from considerations of racial difference or economic stratification, and we will ask: what, if anything, unifies this tradition of literature, and how might feminist methodology offer a way of reading and grappling with the various forms of subjugation that structure contemporary life."

Students engage born-digital texts alongside of traditional print-based genres and consider the relationship between written, audio-visual and/or interactive modes. Classes include craft-based discussions, peer critiques, and hands-on instruction in media production software, which prepare students to produce their own creative digital texts through a series of independent writing projects.

The course focuses on gaining experience reading peer reviewed scientific literature, and understanding how research is used to guide physical activity programs and policies. This course provides an overview of the epidemiological evidence on associations between physical activity and a variety of health outcomes with an emphasis on chronic cardio-metabolic disease and cancer, key determinants of physical activity behaviors in different populations, and effective approaches for increasing participation in physical activity. Special attention is given to developing critical thinking skills and understanding the application of epidemiological methods to the science of physical activity and health outcome. The class is also structures to provide opportunities for in-depth analysis and discussion as to how various research methods are used to study physical activity."

This experiential course, which can be field- or laboratory-based, and located on site at UMass Boston or off-campus, provides an opportunity for students to apply relevant clinical, communications and management skills. The practicum is designed to support students' translation of knowledge acquired in prior EHS courses to actual skill-based practice. In close consultation with the course instructor and major advisor, the student is placed in an EHS department-approved site to complete a minimum of 100 hours of experience. In addition, the student attends a class meeting once per month. The classroom meetings provide a forum for students to reflect on and assess their practicum learning experiences with their course instructor and peers. Discussion extends beyond the student's skill practicum experience to include on-going evaluation or re-evaluation of career goals.",

A particular emphasis is placed on the non-governmental sector and its role in addressing immediate and long-term issues and crisis and in promoting the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In this course students will learn how to interpret the world of opinion, ethics, judgment , need, and urgency as it is driven by what is known and what is transmitted. They will realize the importance of communication, public awareness and understanding of ethical and moral concerns and how these interrelate with social inclusion at all levels."

            "description": "This course examines key concepts of change management in community settings. It provides an introduction to social change theories and their application to community settings and to models and approaches to community change. The course teaches students strategies for identifying and addressing issues in the change-managment process, and for managing change more effectively, giving consideration to the cultural, racial, ethnic, and socio-economic make-up of the community. The role of culture and the impact of globalization on change efforts and implications for practitioners in global inclusion and social development will be considered as well. Real-world examples focused on health, disability, and development, provided by leaders who are experienced change agents, will demonstrate how communities can effectively manage change. The course also teaches students how to assess the needs and abilities of communities for change and to evaluate community change efforts with a particular emphasis on stakeholder involvement. Master's and doctoral students in global inclusion and social development can choose to take this course or the Strategies for Systemic Change course."

This course familiarizes students with theories, research and practice regarding the role of the state and governance as it pertains to inclusion and development. The course examines the emergence of the state, including pre- and non-Westphalian state contexts, specifically experiences of colonization and the development, and the near-universal inheritance of the modern state. We explore contemporary forms of the state, and pressures emerging and surrounding it, including those of the market, civil society and democracy. The course then moves to the recent transformation of statehood and the shift to new modes of governance, specifically the role of non-state actors across scale--from local to global--and investigates how various institutions, corporate power and political society shift the role of states.

Through these relationships the course illustrates the common goals and strategies of the health and human rights communities which both seek to advance the wellbeing of individuals, communities and populations. Much of the course focuses specifically on the right to health, its definition, normative content and methods of implementation. the course uses case studies from around the globe to consider the value of incorporating human rights generally and the right to health specifically into law, policymaking, programming and practice. Students prepare a final project by selecting one health issue and exploring frameworks, strategies and tools to address it from a human rights-based perspective."

The emphasis is on field-based qualitative research methods and data gathering techniques for doctoral and master's students to use in challenging settings on key governance, health, development and related concerns, especially (but not only) in the developing countries. A primary objective and output of the course is for students to develop a field-based research proposal that frames a social research problem; and more clearly defines the research design and accompanying research methods -to advance the students' thinking/work on their master's or dissertation proposal, while thinking through key aspects of the field research portion of their research. Principles, practice, debates and ethics concerns are also covered in the course."

It addresses both normal aging and psychopathology. Of special concern is the question of whether there are any systematic intrinsic psychological or personality changes associated with development in later life. The course also focuses on the processes used to cope with age-associated transitions ranging from the empty nest to impending death. It explores theoretical models for understanding coping and adaptation, developmental changes, and psychopathology. Other topics include clarification of the causes and nature of the most common psychopathologies, depression, and Alzheimer's disease; and the psychodynamics of institutionalization and family care of the very old."

Decisions about programs and services will need to be made with innovation, forethought and deliberation, decisions that need to be based on law and ethics. How should limited resources be offered to this growing elder population? Will they be allocated, and how? Is allocation ethical? And, as society moves forward, how will other changes impact elders?

''Diversity'' in this course is construed broadly to incorporate race, ethnicity, gender identity and sexual orientation, immigration status, and ability, as well as how these identities interact.  Particular attention will be directed toward understanding intersections with historical experiences, demographic characteristics, life course trajectories, cultural characteristics and socioeconomic differences in shaping diverse later life experiences. Opportunities and challenges for research will be examined."

The main focus of the course is to familiarize students with the philosophical and theoretical underpinnings of qualitative inquiry and some of the major approaches to qualitative research, including ethnography, phenomenology, grounded theory, narrative inquiry, case study, and participatory action research. The course gives an opportunity for students to critically consider their own research interests in light of qualitative inquiry, design and conduct a small-scale research study reflecting those research interests, and read and interpret both theoretical and research literature on qualitative methods. In addition, during the course, students will have a range of opportunities to reflect on and question their own assumptions about the nature of knowledge and knowledge creation through qualitative research.",

Students will learn how versions of the past are created, communicated and institutionalized as history at historic sites, museums, historic houses, landscapes, and the web. They will explore successful models of interpretation in public venues and examine dilemmas in community collaboration and interpretation for and with the public. Students examine the roles of evidence, history and politics in interpretation; venues, cultures and histories that shape interpretation; interpretive methods and practices in using historical evidence in public history venues; and issues and practices that challenge the practice of public history now and into the future. The course offers students several opportunities to engage in this exploration through readings, assignments, class discussion, guest speakers, case studies, visits to actual and virtual sites, written and oral assignments, and practicum experiences with a community partner."

A generation of reformers and political activists reorganized cities, confronting issues of poverty and dangerous working conditions, and looking to government to regulate the unbridled power of large corporations. Artists challenged European traditions in art, music and literature. The period also saw racial polarization and a new, rights-oriented African American movement. Unprecedented immigration and the massive influx of so-called ''new immigrants'' from southern and eastern Europe stirred nativist and racial exclusionist sentiment."

The students will be given close supervision by a UMB History Department faculty member and will be required to meet the same requirement as graduate students meet in laboratories. In other words, the three-credit internship will require 2.5 hours of work per week, per credit, or a total of 7.5 hours of intern work per week. In the process of the internship, students will learn from public history practitioners such as museum professionals, tour guides, re-enactors, documentary film makers as well as from scholars of history. These practitioners will guide students through the problems and solutions involved in planning and funding public history projects as well as the problems in selecting, conducting and oral and community history projects and interpreting and presenting historical information in various venues in order to engage and educate public audiences."

The course starts with a session of definitions and preliminary discussions to show the big picture of the risk management discipline. The course then shows how different risks that an organization faces can be categorized according to their natures, probabilities and impacts. This is followed by describing how the probability of these risks can be reduced and how the impacts can be mitigated. The course finally focuses on how an organization can recover faster and more efficiently from a realized risk. Throughout this course, the emphasis is to show not only the importance of managing the inevitable risks as source of opportunity for organizations. This course is different form ''financial risk management'' since it does not discuss financial instruments to hedge against risks. Rather it tries to show how ''operational decisions'' can influence the probability and impacts of different types of risks. In addition, this class disc uses how to plan for recovery process."

            "description": "This course introduces the essential ideas and computational techniques that modern scientists or engineers will need in order to carry out their work.  In most scientific modeling projects, investigators have to deal with very large systems of linear equations, understanding of which requires powerful computers, and a firm understanding of the vast number of existing pertinent algorithms. The main goal of the course is to provide an introduction to algorithmic and mathematical foundations of high-performance matrix computations.  Topics include linear algebraic systems, the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix and some of its modern applications. We will discuss Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its applications to data analysis. We will study linear transformations and change of basis. We will discuss complex vector spaces and the Jordan canonical form of Matrices. We will discuss non-negative matrices and Perron-Frobenius Theory. We will explain multiple matrix factorizations, such as LU, QR, NMF. For each of these topics we will discuss numerical computer algorithms and their implementations. In particular we will discuss in detail eigenvalue estimation, including iterative and direct methods, such as Hausholder methods, tri-diagonalization, power methods, and power methods with shifts. We will explain concepts of numerical analysis that are important to consider when we talk about the implementation of algorithms, such as stability and convergence. We will discuss iterative methods as well as direct ones, their advantages and disadvantages. The methods and their applications will be illustrated using a common programming language such as python and/or R. The course will emphasize mathematical and software engineering methods that will allow students to fully participate at all levels of algorithm design and implementation.",

The course is divided roughly into two parts that deal with macroeconomic and microeconomic issues. In the macro section such key aggregates as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, inflation rate, and balance of payments, which are of importance to the firm manager, are discussed. Discussions focus on a critical examination of how these aggregates are measured and determined in various competing theoretical models. The theory discussed here then serves as an analytical tool in understanding and evaluating economic policies related to such current economic issues as unemployment, inflation, and trade imbalances. In the micro section, emphasis is given to a) the theory of markets, how prices and quantities are determined in markets and factors that affect these prices and quantities; and b) how firms compete in different market environments. Besides concentrating on the theory, special attention is given to how the concepts covered are applied to real-world microeconomic problems.",

Accountants have a critical role in providing relevant information for planning, decision making, and control. Due to the impact technology has on providing this information; accountants must have a thorough understanding of Accounting Information Systems (AIS) and also be proficient in the use of technology for providing information. In order to ensure the bright future of the accounting profession, we must use technology to its full advantage. In this course students will gain a basic understanding of AIS in the areas of 1) Information Systems, 2) AIS Applications, 3) Database Concepts, 4) Internal Control, 5) Data Analytics and 6) Auditing of AIS. In this course we will supplement lectures with active learning and group work in order to make class fun and interesting while we learn! Students will complete various software assignments to gain exposure to modern technologies. This is not a computer or technology course - it is a business and information course in which you will later apply theoretical concepts learned using computers.",

The student acquires an appreciation of management science approaches to solving problems in business or government, public or private and profit or not-for-profit sectors. Examples of problems from various sectors and from various functional areas are discussed. Students gather data about these problems, develop models, and explore solutions, using computer-based analysis and managerial judgment. In addition, ''what if'' analyses are used to determine the sensitivity of model solutions to uncertainties in data inputs. The course is computer-based, using many of the advanced features on Excel and/or other software packages."

Assessment, diagnostic, therapeutic, and health teaching strategies are applied to a continuum of health promotion/illness problems with a focus on the primary care of adults and older adults across the continuum of care.  Students build skills in seeing increasingly complex patients with a combination of higher risk, acute illness, and chronic health problems where atypical disease presentation and challenges to disease treatment exist.  Seminars are grounded in learning the application of theory and research to the domains of practice of the adult/gerontological nurse practitioner including the management of patient health and illness, the teaching-coaching function of the nurse practitioner, and ensuring the quality of health care services.  Interdisciplinary collaborative practice skills are developed.  Students develop role competencies under the supervision of nurse practitioner or physician preceptors and faculty in a variety of health care settings.  Seminar discussions include an exploration of special topics in disease management to improve quality, access and cost of primary health care for diverse populations (or communities) with an emphasis on underserved populations, where diversity includes age, gender, race/ethnicity, culture, religion, language, sexual orientation, abilities, and socioeconomic status.",

Students will formulate coherent philosophical, theoretical, conceptual, and methodological understandings in their appraisal of knowledge gained from previous coursework. Considerations for new inquiry that advance nursing science and health sciences will be explored. Conducting an effective and comprehensive review of the literature or policy analysis from conceptual and methodological perspectives will also be emphasized. This course is designed to give doctoral students opportunities to engage classmates and professors in dialogue and discussion about integrating concepts and methods into the process of research development. Students should take advantage of this opportunity to build their research community by engaging fully in class discussion with fellow students and faculty."

Attention will be paid to the processes of building equitable partnerships with community members and to the ethics, power dynamics and rigor of action research. This course will model and give students experience with core elements and principles of participatory research, including participation, reflection, co-learning, learning by doing, relationship-building and collaboration. The course features practical application in conducting this type of action research. Students will work in partnership with a community organization to conduct a project that supports the racial equity and social justice goals of the organization. Using apprenticeship-style and group-based learning, students will work as a team to develop and conduct the project together, guided and supported by the instructor. Reflecting upon the experience of conducting participatory research, students will deepen their understanding of community engaged scholarship, foster the skills and orientations necessary to practice it, and consider the role it will play in their research and professional career as well as their lives as members of diverse communities."

Emphasis is placed on multi-method, multi-source strategies using approaches such as direct observation, interviewing techniques, rating scales, and self-report measures. The projective hypothesis and projective methods are reviewed, including storytelling and drawing techniques. Special issues in cross-cultural assessment and in assessing minority students and students with disabilities are considered.

These are the same contexts that lead to the formation of such things as social movements, political parties, trade unions, and organized mass actions such as consumption, strikes, and revolutions.  Social theory emerges from these contexts and is only a more reflective expression of the disputes and agendas that dominate ordinary communication about social and political issues.  It is itself a social and political issues.  It is itself a social product with a multitude of everyday contexts of origination."

The course is a critical exploration of the intersection of urban planning and social movements and responses to the post-WWII urban crisis by government(s), particularly the Federal level. It also traces the rise of community development during the 1960's by weaving three interrelated trends; rise of new social movements; changes to the production of space: globalism; and the advent of the post-industrial/informational society; and responses by government at all levels. All three trends transformed urban planning and urban planning theory and practice. The course also adds skills knowledge for urban planners working closely with or wishing to become part of community development organizations in the US or elsewhere.",

Doing feminist research involves rethinking disciplinary assumptions and methodologies, developing new understandings of what counts as knowledge, seeking alternative ways of understanding the origins of problems/issues, formulating new ways of asking questions and redefining the relationship between subjects and objects of study. The course will focus on methodology, i.e., the theory and analysis of how research should proceed. We shall be especially attentive to epistemological issues--pre-suppositions about the nature of knowledge and in their connections to methodologies and research methods. Further, we shall explore how these connections are formed in the traditional disciplines and raise questions about why they are inadequate and / or problematic for feminist inquiry."
